      O denying it&mdash;there was something uncanny about the place at the very
      first glance. The paymaster admitted that to himself as his ambulance
      slowly drove in, and his escort of half a dozen troopers came clattering
      after. It was his first visit to the spot, and he shrugged his broad
      shoulders and murmured a word of caution to the silent clerk who sat
      beside him:

      &ldquo;I want you to keep eyes and ears open here, Staines. We've got to make a
      night of it. You remember that this is where Sergeant Dinsmore was
      murdered, and I've heard nothing but bad accounts of the people for the
      last six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Staines was apparently a man who wasted no words. Acquiescence with
      him may have been expressed by silence. At all events he made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever at the ranch before, when you made the trips with Colonel
      Forte?&rdquo; asked the paymaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, it's&mdash;all strange to me hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are we from Canyon del Muerto now, sergeant?&rdquo; asked the officer
      of the bearded trooper who rode close alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen miles, sir, on a bee line, but at least twenty by the road. We're
      off the direct trail now. We could have got through the canyon and reached
      the camp before this if that mule hadn't gone lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; said Staines in a low tone, &ldquo;I can get a saddle horse or mule
      here, no doubt. Had I not better ride right on? I can reach Captain
      Rawlins' camp by 9 or 10 o'clock. He will be mighty anxious at your
      non-arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of sending one man ahead; I don't like to let you go. It
      will wear you out for to-morrow's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it won't, sir; I'm feeling fresh enough, and the change from wagon
      to saddle will just suit me. I think I'd better go.&rdquo; And there was an
      eager look in Staines' clear-cut face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll think about it&rdquo; was the dubious answer. &ldquo;These cavalry men are the
      proper ones to send, not a paymaster's clerk. If anything befell you on
      the route I would be crippled in making payments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would be apt to befall me, sir; I know that road well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said all was strange to you hereabouts&rdquo; said the paymaster
      quickly. But the clerk showed no discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said here, around the ranch. The direct road lies off there nearly nine
      miles to the southwest, sir. That is the one we always took going to
      Tucson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paymaster relapsed into silence. It is all very well to have
      subordinates who know far more than does the senior officer, yet the
      latter does not always find it agreeable. His own clerk having resigned
      some six months previous and returned to the East, when Major Sherrick was
      ordered from San Francisco to Arizona he had employed Mr. Staines at the
      urgent request of the officer whom he relieved. Staines had property
      interests in the Territory, he was told, and wanted to remain. He was a
      man profoundly versed in his duties; accurate, temperate, reliable and of
      unimpeachable character, said his recommenders. Sherrick was glad to get
      him, for he himself had no head for figures, and had been made a paymaster
      from civil life simply because his uncle the Senator found him a failure
      in every other capacity, and demanded the appointment of an Executive who
      could not deny him, though he felt like kicking himself when he looked at
      the long list of grizzled, war-tried captains who were wistful applicants
      for the longed-for promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall Mexican stepped forward with much urbanity and grace of manner to
      assist the paymaster to alight as the ambulance stopped in front of the
      ranch, and Major Sherrick looked with emotions of surprise upon Pedro
      Ruiz, the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say that's the scoundrel we heard so much bad talk
      about at headquarters?&rdquo; he whispered to Staines at the first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same, sir; the most accomplished cutthroat in Arizona, if we can
      believe our senses and disregard evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are his men? He seems alone here, all but that old greaser yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dios sabe,&rdquo; answered the clerk briefly, though his eyes glanced quickly
      away toward the purpling range to the south. &ldquo;But we shall need our guards
      every moment we are here, sir, that's certain.&rdquo; An hour later night had
      settled down upon the broad valley, black and forbidding. All day long the
      wind had been sighing about the corral, whirling clouds of dust from the
      loose, sandy soil and sifting it in through many a chink and crevice over
      the floor of Pedro's ranch. The great ranges to the northwest, the Sierras
      to the south, were whitecapped at their lofty summits, but all over the
      arid miles of surrounding desert the sun had been hotly blazing from noon
      to the dewless eve, and not until it sank behind the western wave did the
      wind sweep down untempered. Through its shallow bed the Gila rolled, a
      lazy, turbid current, not a rifle shot away. Quicksands and muddy pools
      flanked its course for miles and barred all attempts at crossing except at
      the point where thrifty Pedro had &ldquo;corduroyed&rdquo; the flats with boards that
      had formerly done duty at the agency building, and, having originally cost
      the paternal Government something in the neighborhood of $1 apiece, had
      now come down to the base uses of daily trampling under foot. The stage to
      the Gripsack Mines, the huge ox teams and triple-hitched wagons, the
      nimble pack mules, even the buckboard with the United States mail, paid
      reluctant tribute into Pedro's dingy palm, though the owners mentally
      damned him for a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody in that part of Arizona well knew that in the unprecedented rise
      of the Gila, a few years back, two of the agency storehouses had been
      floated away down the stream, accompanied by a dense flotilla of joists,
      scantling and clapboards, which had been piled up on the river bank after
      weeks of laborious transportation from Plummer's saw mill in the San
      Gabriel. So, too, had sundry casks of bacon, barrels of beans and bales of
      Indian goods; and while portions of this flood-swept assortment were found
      stranded and scattered along the winding shores as far down as Pedro's
      bailiwick, not so much as a solitary shingle had passed beyond, and the
      laws of flotsam and jetsam had received at the hands of this shrewd
      &ldquo;greaser&rdquo; their most liberal construction. More than once had the Federal
      authorities been compelled to proceed to stringent measures with Pedro and
      arraign him before a jury of his peers on charges of having robbed and
      defrauded the General Government, and more than once with prompt and
      cheering unanimity had the jury pronounced him not guilty, a service which
      he never failed to requite in kind when Garcia, Gomez or Sancho came up
      for his turn. And now the old Mexican was proprietor of a goodly ranch,
      built mainly of adobe, it is true, as were his roomy corrals and
      storehouses, yet roofed, floored, partitioned, doored and menu for either
      breakfast, dinner or supper, at a charge of $1 a head for any and all
      travelers who sought to appease their appetite at his table. He kept a
      bar, too, and dealt out villainous &ldquo;tanglefoot&rdquo; and windowed, too, by the
      unwilling contributions wrung from Uncle Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three years he had furnished bacon, <i>frijoles</i> and fried eggs,
      the unvarying fiery mescal to such stomachs as could stand the onslaught
      and the tax of two bits a thimbleful. He ran a &ldquo;brace game&rdquo; of monte
      whenever the packers were drunk or strangers fool enough to play. He was a
      thorough-paced rascal in the opinion of every &ldquo;gringo&rdquo; who passed that
      way, and a man of unimpeachable character according to all records in the
      case. He was a &ldquo;greaser&rdquo; of whom everything had been said and nothing
      proved; that is, to the satisfaction of an old-time Arizona jury. But Mr.
      Whitlock, the new United States District Attorney, was said to be &ldquo;laying&rdquo;
       for Pedro, and between those who knew them both and were aware of the
      possibilities of finding twelve better men and truer outside of Maricopa
      County, bets were even as to the result.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let me get that thieving greaser across the line into Yavapai,&rdquo; said
      a local luminary, &ldquo;and I'll find a jury that will hang him on sight or
      lynch him on general principles.&rdquo; But Pedro knew better than to venture
      northward along the tempting shores of the Hassayampa. Even the chance of
      collecting a bad debt from a fellow countryman, known to be lurking in
      Wickenburg, failed to lure Pedro thither. He smiled suggestively, showing
      his white teeth and waving aside the blue smoke of his cigarrito with
      sinewy brown hand. &ldquo;A&mdash;Wickenburg is too damn close to Yavapai, and
      Yavapai to 'ell,&rdquo; he remarked. And it had more than once been said of
      Pedro that he spoke English like a native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rancho Ruiz&rdquo; was the sonorous and pretentious title he had bestowed upon
      the establishment to which the winding Arizona roadway led. &ldquo;Cutthroat
      Crossing&rdquo; was what the soldiers and placer miners had called this half
      ferry, half ford of Pedro's ever since the body of young Sergeant Dinsmore
      had been found stranded on a sand bar of the Gila two miles below,' his
      neck and his money belt slashed by the same knife. Going into Yuma with
      well-lined pockets, Dinsmore had been warned to make no stay among the
      gang of monte players always hovering about Pedro's. But he had been a
      bold and successful gambler at Tucson. He had nothing but contempt for
      Mexican bravos and confidence in his own prowess as a shot. The card table
      had attractions he could not well resist, but the ranch had still another&mdash;Pedro's
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was when he was sent thither with a squad of a dozen troopers,
      hunting up the missing sergeant, that Lieutenant Adriance caught sight of
      this siren of a senorita. She could not have been more than seventeen, and
      her mother would have denied her even that number of years. &ldquo;She is a mere
      child,&rdquo; protested Senora Dolores, when the subject was mentioned. Pedro
      had moved up from Sonora only a few years before, and had lived a while at
      the old Mexico-Spanish town of Tucson, whither, ere long, there came
      unflattering tales as to the cause of his change of residence. He had
      money, and that in Arizona covered more sins than charity. The boundary
      line lay conveniently near. Extradition was an unpracticed art in the days
      whereof we write. Apaches of the mountains and assassins of the mines
      found equal refuge across the border, and in exchange we received such
      choice spirits as proved too tough for even a Mexican town to tolerate. Of
      such was Pedro; but no one to look at Pedro's daughter would have called
      her a felon's child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night that Adriance reached the rancho on the search just mentioned he
      had purposely left his little escort some distance up the Gila, and
      advanced alone to reconnoitre. It was a perfectly still evening, soft and
      starry. The hoofs of his broncho made no sound upon the sandy waste of
      road, and not even the dogs about the corral seemed aware of his coming.
      Adriance had thrice visited the ranch before, when returning from scout or
      pursuit of Apaches, and never once had he been greeted by feminine voice
      about the premises. It was with no little surprise, then, that he heard
      the tinkle of a guitar and the sound of low, soft, girlish tones singing a
      plaintive melody. He had heard many a Mexican ditty, and had pronounced
      the singers twangy, shrill and nasal; but this was different. He had come
      to Rancho Ruiz with every expectation of finding evidence of the murder of
      one of his most valued troopers, and here, on the instant of his arrival,
      was disarmed by a song. East of the ranch there stood a little
      lattice-work structure, something after the manner of a summer house, and
      from thence the sounds proceeded. The lieutenant leaped from his horse and
      strode to the entrance, wondering what manner of woman he should find
      beyond. There was not light enough to distinguish either form or feature,
      but over in the farther corner was a shadowy something in white. The song
      continued but a moment before the singer became aware of the equally
      shadowy form at the entrance, and stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leon!&rdquo; spoke a girlish voice in the Spanish tongue, &ldquo;you frightened me.
      Is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Felipe, otherwise Phil. Adriance, of the American Cavalry, senorita,
      and far more surprised than you are at seeing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl started to her feet as though flight was her first impulse, then
      hesitated. Did not the &ldquo;Senor Teniente&rdquo; bar the way in merely standing in
      the entrance?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, I beg of you,&rdquo; implored the young officer, &ldquo;it is so
      long since I have heard a song in a woman's voice. It is such a surprise
      to hear one now. Do sing for me again. I will have to stand here where I
      can hold my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was silent, then: &ldquo;You have been to the rancho? You have
      seen my father?&rdquo; she asked at length, her voice tremulous and almost
      inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? No, I have just come; I am alone, and heard your song and forgot
      everything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise she came hurriedly forward out of the dusk, and stood
      close to his side, looking fearfully over toward the night lights at the
      bar, whence the sounds of Mexican voices could be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone? You came here alone? O senor, ride on or ride back. Stay not here!
      Not at the rancho! There are wicked men&mdash;not my father; not Pedro
      Ruiz, but&mdash;there are others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true? Are you Pedro's daughter?&rdquo; queried the lieutenant,
      evidently far more impressed with this fact than with her tidings. &ldquo;I
      never knew he had a child like you, and I have been here often and have
      never seen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;have seen you, senor, when you were last here, and I saw you,
      too, at the <i>cuartel</i> at Tucson. Do you know&mdash;do you remember
      the day of the race?&rdquo; And her dark eyes were for one instant lifted
      timidly to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this possible?&rdquo; he exclaimed, seizing her hand as it fell listlessly
      by her side. &ldquo;Let me see your face. Surely I have heard your voice
      before.&rdquo; But she shrank back, half timid, half capricious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not; I must go, senor, and you&mdash;you must ride away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now her eyes glanced half fearfully toward the house, then sought his
      face in genuine anxiety. He had been fumbling in the pocket of his hunting
      shirt, and suddenly drew forth a little silver case. The next instant,
      while he held her wrist firmly with one hand, the brilliant flame of an
      electric match flashed over her face and form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>

      <a href="images/0027.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, senor,&rdquo; she cried, even when bowing her blushing face upon her bared
      arm, &ldquo;this is madness! Put it out!&rdquo; Then, like a frightened deer, she went
      bounding to the ranch, but not before he had recognized in her the pretty
      Mexican girl with whom he had thrice danced at the <i>festa</i> at Tucson
      and whose name he had vainly sought to learn. Nor did he again see her on
      this visit. Nor did he hear again her voice. Returning with his men at
      dawn, he began the day's investigations and had occasion to ask many
      questions of old Pedro, who promptly answered that he well remembered the
      sergeant and that the sergeant had drunk at his bar; had partaken of his
      cheer; had stabled his horse at the corral; but that, after gambling with
      &ldquo;los otros,&rdquo; men of whom he, Pedro, knew naught, the sergeant had gone on
      his way. More he could not tell. He shrugged his shoulders and protested
      his ignorance even of the names of the men with whom Dinsmore had gambled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You enter my house, Senor Teniente. You ask for food, for drink. You pay.
      You go. Ask I you your name&mdash;your home? No! Should I demand it of any
      caballero who so come and go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And failing in extracting information from the master, Adriance sought the
      hirelings and found them equally reticent. Shrewd frontiersmen and
      campaigners in his little detachment were equally unsuccessful until
      nearly night, when a brace of prospectors rode in and said they saw what
      looked to be a human body over on a sand bar down the Gila. Then Pedro's
      face had turned ashen gray, and one of his henchmen trembled violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dinsmore was given such soldier burial as his comrades could devise,
      and Pedro, of his own accord, and with much reverential gravity of mien,
      had graced the ceremony with his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man of the cavalry detachment felt morally certain that Pedro Ruiz
      knew far more than he would tell, but there was no way in which they could
      proceed farther, and civil process was ineffectual in those days except in
      the court of final jurisdiction of which Judge Lynch was sole presiding
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adriance rode away with a distinct sense of discomfiture at heart. What
      business had he to feel baffled and chagrined at his failure to see that
      girl again when the original object of his mission had been the discovery
      of Dinsmore's fate? What right had he to wish to speak with the daughter
      of the man whom he believed an accessory to the sergeant's murder? &ldquo;Do not
      let them know you have seen me&rdquo; she had whispered ere she scurried away to
      the ranch, and as neither mother nor daughter once appeared during the
      presence of his escort about the corral, there seemed no way in which he
      could open the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months passed, during which period he had been sent to Tucson on
      escort duty, and while there had sought and found some well-to-do Mexican
      residents whom he remembered as being friends of the graceful girl who had
      danced so delightfully with him at the <i>baile</i> only the year before.
      From them he learned her name, Isabel, and something of her history. And
      the very next scout down the Gila found him in command and eager to go,
      and this very night, black and forbidding, that had settled down on Rancho
      Ruiz after the arrival of Paymaster Sherrick and his train, who should
      come riding noiselessly through the gloaming but Lieutenant Adriance
      himself, as before, all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearing the lights of the rancho and moving at slow and cautious walk, his
      ears alert for every sound, the lieutenant became aware of the fact that
      Roderick, his pet horse, was pricking up his own ears and showing vast
      interest in some mysterious and unseen presence which they were steadily
      approaching. Before he had got within two hundred yards of the dim light
      of the house he caught sight of a lantern or two flitting about the
      corral. Then Roderick quickened his nimble walk and began edging off to
      the right front, where presently, against the low western sky, Adriance
      could distinguish some object like a big covered wagon, and plainly heard
      the pawing and snorting of a horse. Roderick evidently wanted to answer,
      but the lieutenant reined him abruptly to the left, and veered away
      southward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now it was not the society of his fellow men he sought. A woman's
      voice, one woman's at least, would have called him eagerly forward from
      the darkness into the light of her waiting eyes. As it was, he made wide
      circuit, and not until well to the south did he again approach the silent
      walls of the corral. And now the wind, blowing toward him, brought with it
      the sound of voices, and Adriance was suddenly warned that someone was
      here, close at hand. Dismounting, the lieutenant slowly led his horse
      toward the dark barrier before him, but not until he had softly traversed
      the length of the southern wall did he become aware of other voices, low
      toned and eager. Around the corner, on the western side, the dark forms of
      a horseman and someone afoot were dimly defined, then a brief conversation
      became audible:
    </p>

      <a href="images/0019.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no time to lose, Leon. Go softly until you are a mile away, then
      ride like hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, but the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shall be yours to-morrow&mdash;now skip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jingle of a Mexican spur, the soft thud of mustang hoofs upon the
      yielding soil were heard a moment, and the horseman rode slowly away
      southwestward, the broad stiff brim of his sombrero revealed against the
      starry sky; then all was silence. The American, whoever he was, still
      stood there. Adriance felt sure he had heard the voice before. As for the
      horseman&mdash;Leon&mdash;that was the name he heard her speak the night
      he surprised her in the little summer house. Who was Leon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>

      <a href="images/0035.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Presently the American turned and strolled slowly back toward the rancho.
      Slipping Roderick's rein over the post at the angle, the lieutenant
      followed. Keeping close to the wall, the stranger led the way, all
      unconscious of pursuit or observation, yet when he reached the next
      corner, whence could be seen the night lights of the rancho and the
      far-away gleam of the camp fire, out toward the Gila, he stopped and
      peered cautiously around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mindful of the evil fame that hung about the premises, Adriance halted too
      and waited. The next moment his heart beat hard. A woman's voice&mdash;soft,
      silvery and young&mdash;had accosted the stranger. It was Isabel's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sent my brother away again, when he had but just returned. Why
      is this, senor? Whither has he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about Leon, Belita,&rdquo; said the American, soothingly, &ldquo;he's all
      right. He has simply ridden over to let Captain Rawlins know of our
      mishap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true, senor! I heard him speak to my father. It is to Sancho
      and to Manuel he rides, and for no good. To what new crime do you lead
      him? Why are they all gone? Why are we alone here this night? Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool, girl,&rdquo; said the man curtly, as he took her by the wrist.
      &ldquo;Come, Leon's gone. Come back to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not gone. He promised me he would not go from me without a word
      to-night. The moment I saw you I knew that trouble would come, and I
      warned him when he returned. You have made him wicked&mdash;you
      Americanos. You are all&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, all, even Teniente Adriance, Isabel. I heard all about you and
      your affair with him. Have a care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He is good. It is not in him to make a gambler and a rover of my
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would make worse of your brother's sister, you fool,&rdquo; the man
      muttered, with brutal emphasis. &ldquo;Come now, no nonsense with that fellow;
      he's as good as married already, I tell you; he is to be married in two
      months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not true!&rdquo; was the fiery answer. &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; And then, with
      feminine inconsequence, &ldquo;Who is she? Who does he marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Senorita Abert&mdash;a lovely girl, too, and rich&mdash;in San
      Francisco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a lie, Staines, and you know it!&rdquo; came in cool and measured
      tones, and Mr. Adriance suddenly stepped from the corner of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staines dropped the captive's hand and recoiled a pace or two with a
      stifled exclamation, half amaze, half dismay; then with sudden effort
      strove to recover himself. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a nervous laugh;
      &ldquo;talk of angels and you hear the rustle, etc. Indeed, lieutenant, I beg
      your pardon, though; I was merely joking with our little Mexican friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mr. Staines; I know a joke when I hear one. Wait here a
      moment, if you please, for I want a word with you. Pardon me for startling
      you, senorita. Will you take my arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was trembling violently. With bowed head and fluttering heart she
      leaned upon the trooper's arm and was slowly led away toward the rancho,
      never seeming to note that the little brown hand that had been so firmly
      taken and drawn within by his was still tightly clasped by that cavalry
      gauntlet. The moment they were out of the earshot of Staines the
      lieutenant bent down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to see you I came here, Isabel; I had hoped to find you at the
      summer house. Come to me there in ten minutes, will you? I must see you
      before I go. First, though, I have to investigate that fellow Staines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I cannot! I dare not! I slipped away from my room because of Leon.
      They will lead him into trouble again. Indeed, I must go back. I must go,
      Senor Felipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember my name, then, little one!&rdquo; he laughed, delightedly. &ldquo;I have
      been to Tucson since I saw you that blessed night, and I heard all about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, senor! It is my mother who calls. List! Let me go, sefior!&rdquo; for his
      arm had suddenly stolen about her waist. &ldquo;Promise you will come&mdash;promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not! O Felipe, no!&rdquo; she cried, for he had with quick impulse
      folded her tightly in his strong embrace and his lips were seeking hers.
      Struggling to avoid them she had hidden her face upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise&mdash;quick!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if I can&mdash;yes. Now let me go.&rdquo; His firm hand turned her glowing
      face to his; his eager lips pressed one lingering kiss just at the corner
      of her pretty mouth. She hurled herself from him then and bounded into the
      darkness. An instant more and he heard the latch of the rear door click; a
      stream of light shot out toward the corral and she was gone. Then slowly
      he returned to the corner of the wall, fully expecting that Staines had
      left. To his surprise, there was the clerk composedly awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you sent Leon Ruiz?&rdquo; was the stern question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not recognize your right to speak to me in that tone, Mr. Adriance.
      If you have nothing else to ask me&mdash;good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, sir! I heard your whispered talk with him and I know there is
      mischief afoot,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, as he strode after the retreating
      form. &ldquo;This thing has got to be explained, and in the major's presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staines halted, and lifting his hat with Castilian grace of manner bowed
      profoundly to the angry officer. &ldquo;Permit me, sir, to conduct you to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, baffled, puzzled, balked in his precious hopes, Mr.
      Adriance returned to the bivouac of his little command. Major Sherrick had
      promptly and fully confirmed the statement of his clerk. It was he who
      told Mr. Staines to employ a ranchman to ride by night to Captain Rawlins,
      and the mysterious caution that surrounded the proceedings was explained
      by the fact that Pedro had refused his permission and that Leon had to be
      bribed to disobey the paternal order. Adriance was dissatisfied and
      suspicious, but what was there left for him to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he had hastened to the summer house, and waited a whole hour, but
      there came no Isabel. It was nearly 10 o'clock when he turned his horse
      over to the care of the guard in a little clump of cottonwoods near the
      Gila.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We remain here to-morrow,&rdquo; he briefly told the sergeant. &ldquo;No need to wake
      the men before 6.&rdquo; With that he went to the little wall tent, pitched for
      his use some yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long he slumbered Adriance could not tell. Ill at ease as to the
      strange conduct of Staines, he had not slept well. Conscience, too, was
      smiting him. Something in the tones of that girlish voice thrilled and
      quivered through his memory. What right had he even to ask her to meet
      him? What wrong had he not wrought in that one kiss?
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody was fumbling at the fastening of the tent flap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is wanted, sergeant?&rdquo; he quickly hailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open, quick!&rdquo; was the low-toned answer. &ldquo;Come to the door. No, no, bring
      no light,&rdquo; was the breathless caution, as he struck a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; he demanded, with strange thrill at heart&mdash;something
      in those tones he well knew&mdash;yet it could not be. A dim figure in
      shrouding <i>serape</i> was crouching at the front tent pole as he threw
      open the flap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Isabel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si&mdash;&mdash; Yes. Hush, senor, no one must hear, no one must know
      'twas I. Quick! Wake your men! Saddle! Ride hard till you catch the
      paymaster! Never leave him till you are beyond Canyon del Muerto, and then
      never come to the rancho again&mdash;never!&rdquo;

      HAT off mule of the paymaster's ambulance been a quadruped of wonderful
      recuperative powers. She had gone nearly dead lame all the previous day,
      and now at 5 o'clock on this breezy morning was trotting along as though
      she had never known a twinge in her life. Mr. Staines was apparently
      nonplussed. Acting on his advice, the paymaster had decided to break camp
      soon after 2 o'clock, make coffee, and then start for Rawlins' camp at
      once. He confidently expected to have to drag along at a slow walk, and
      his idea was to get well through the Canyon del Muerto before the heat of
      the day. The unexpected recovery of Jenny, however, enabled them to go
      bowling ahead over the level flat, and at sunrise they were already in
      sight of the northern entrance to the gorge. It was odd how early Mr.
      Staines began to develop lively interest in the condition of that mule.
      First he suggested to the driver that he was going too fast, and would
      bring on that lameness again; but the driver replied that it was Jenny
      herself who was doing most of the pulling. Then Staines became fearful
      lest the cavalry escort should get exhausted by such steady trotting, and
      ventured to say to Major Sherrick that they ought to rein up on their
      account. Sherrick was eager to push ahead, and, like most other men not to
      the manner born, never for a moment thought of such a thing as a horse's
      getting used up by simply carrying a man-at-arms six hours at ceaseless
      trot or lope. However, he knew that Staines was far more experienced in
      such matters than he, and so could not disregard his advice.

    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it, sergeant, are we going too fast for you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it, sir,&rdquo; was the cheery answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're glad enough to go lively now and rest all day in the shade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see how it is, Staines; they don't want to slack up speed. We'll get
      to Rawlins' in time for breakfast at this rate,&rdquo; and again Staines was
      silent. Presently the team began the ascent of a rolling wave of foothill,
      around which the roadway twisted as only Arizona roadways can, and at the
      crest the driver reined in to give his mules a &ldquo;breather.&rdquo; Staines leaped
      from the ambulance for a stretch. The troopers promptly dismounted and
      loosened saddle girths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder is the mouth of the Canyon, sir,&rdquo; said the sergeant, pointing to a
      rift in the range to the south, now gorgeously lighted up by the morning
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is the defile, sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than four miles, sir&mdash;that is, the Canyon itself&mdash;but
      it is crooked as a ram's horn, and the approach on the other side is a
      long, winding valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When were you there last?&rdquo; asked Staines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six months ago, just after Dins-more was murdered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staines turned quickly away and strolled back a few yards along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew Dinsmore, then?&rdquo; asked the paymaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him well, sir. We had served together during the war. They said he
      fell in love with a pretty Mexican girl at Tucson, and she would not
      listen to him. Some of the men heard that she was a daughter of old Pedro
      who keeps that ranch, and that it was hoping to see her that he went
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I remember hearing about it all then,&rdquo; said the paymaster. &ldquo;Did
      you ever see anything of the man who was said to have killed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonora Bill? No, sir; and I don't know anyone who ever did. He was always
      spoken of as the chief of a gang of cutthroats and stage robbers down
      around Tucson. They used to masquerade as Apaches sometimes&mdash;that's
      the way they were never caught. The time they robbed Colonel Wood and
      killed his clerk 'I' troop was scouting not ten miles away, and blessed if
      some of the very gang didn't gallop to Lieutenant Breese and swear the
      Apaches had attacked their camp here in Canyon del Muerto, so that when
      the lieutenant was wanted to chase the thieves his troop couldn't be found
      anywhere&mdash;he was 'way up here hunting for Apaches in the Maricopa
      range. The queer thing about that gang was that they always knew just when
      a paymaster's outfit or a Government officer with funds would be along. It
      was those fellows that robbed Major Rounds, the quartermaster, and jumped
      the stage when Lieutenant Spaulding and his wife were aboard. She had
      beautiful diamonds that they were after, but the lieutenant fooled them&mdash;he
      had them sent by express two days afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Staines came back toward the ambulance at this moment, took a field
      glass from its case, and retraced his steps along the road some twenty
      yards. Here he adjusted the glass and looked long toward the northeast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready to start, sir,&rdquo; said the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major swung himself up to his seat; the troopers quietly &ldquo;sinched&rdquo;
       their saddles and mounted, and still the clerk stood there absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Staines!&rdquo; shouted the paymaster, impatiently, &ldquo;we're waiting for
      you.&rdquo; And still he did not move. The sergeant whirled his horse about and
      clattered back to where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir, the major's waiting.&rdquo; Staines turned abruptly and, silent as
      ever, hurried to the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you staring at so long?&rdquo; said the paymaster, pettishly, as his
      assistant clambered in. &ldquo;I shouted two or three times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staines' face was pale, yet there were drops of sweat upon his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I saw a party of horsemen out there on the flats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said the paymaster, with sudden interest. &ldquo;Where? Let me
      look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't see now, sir. Even the dust cloud is gone. They are behind that
      low ridge some eight or ten miles out there in the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, driver, it's only cattle from the ranch or something of that kind.
      I didn't know, by the way you looked and spoke, but that it might be some
      of Sonora Bill's gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, sir; they haven't been heard of for a year, and once away from
      Pedro's we are safe enough anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the four-mule team was winding slowly up a rocky path.
      On both sides the heights were steep, covered with a thick undergrowth of
      scrub oak and juniper. Here and there rocky cliffs jutted out from the
      hillside and stood like sentinels along the way. The sergeant, with one
      trooper, rode some distance ahead, their carbines &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; and ready for
      use, for Edwards was an old campaigner, and, though he thought it far from
      probable that any outlaws would be fools enough to attempt to &ldquo;get away
      with&rdquo; a paymaster's bank when he and his five men were the guardians and
      Captain Rawlins with his whole troop was but a short distance away, he had
      learned the lesson of precaution. Major Sherrick, with his iron safe under
      his own seat, grasped a rifle in both hands. The driver was whistling
      softly to himself and glancing attentively ahead, for there was a
      continuous outcrop of boulders all along the road. The remaining troopers,
      four in number, rode close behind or alongside the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they reached a point where, after turning a precipitous ledge of
      rock, glistening in the morning sunshine, they saw before them a somewhat
      steep incline. Here, without a word, Staines swung lightly from the
      vehicle and trudged for a moment alongside; then he stooped to adjust his
      boot lace, and when Sherrick looked back the clerk was coming jauntily
      after them, only a dozen paces in rear. In this order they pushed ahead
      perhaps a hundred yards farther, moving slowly up the defile, and Staines
      could easily have regained his distance, but for some reason failed to do
      so. Suddenly, and for no apparent cause, Jenny and her mate shied
      violently, swerved completely around and were tangled up with the wheel
      team before the driver could use the lash. Even his ready blasphemy failed
      to straighten things out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for those rocks up there on the right!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Grab their
      heads, Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke the rocky walls of the Canyon resounded with the crash of
      a score of firearms. The driver, with a convulsive gasp, toppled forward
      out of his seat, his hand still clinching the reins. One of the troopers
      clapped his hand to his forehead, his reins falling useless upon his
      horse's neck, and reeled in the saddle as his charger whirled about and
      rushed, snorting with fright, down the narrow road. At the instant of the
      firing the sound of a dozen &ldquo;spats&rdquo; told where the leaden missiles had
      torn through the stiff canvas cover of the ambulance; and Sherrick, with
      blanched face, leaped from the riddled vehicle and plunged heavily forward
      upon his hands and knees. Two of the troopers sprang from their saddles,
      and, crouching behind a boulder across the road, opened fire up the
      opposite hillside. The sergeant and his comrade, bending low over their
      horses' necks, came thundering back down the Canyon, just in time to see
      the mules whirl about so suddenly as to throw the ambulance on its side.
      The iron safe was hurled into the shallow ditch; the wagon bed dragged
      across the prostrate form of the paymaster, rolling him over and over half
      a dozen times, and then, with a wreck of canvas, splinters, chains and
      traces clattering at their heels, the four mules went rattling away down
      the gorge.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump for shelter, men!&rdquo; shouted Sergeant Edwards, as he dragged the
      senseless form of the major under the great ledge to the right. &ldquo;Stand
      them off as long as you can! Come out of your holes, you cowardly hounds!&rdquo;
       he roared, shaking his fist at the smoke-wreathed rocks up the heights.
      &ldquo;Come out and fight fair! There's only five of us left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here in the road lay the major, bleeding from cuts and bruises, with every
      breath knocked out of his battered body; yonder, his hands 'clinched in
      the death agony, the stiffening form of the driver&mdash;plucky to the
      last. Twenty yards away down the road, all in a heap, lay one poor soldier
      shot through the head, and now past praying for. One of the others was
      bleeding from a gash along the cheek where a bullet had zipped its way,
      and Edwards shouted in vain for Staines to join them; the clerk had
      disappeared. For full five minutes the desperate combat was maintained;
      the sergeant and his little squad crouching behind the nearest rocks and
      firing whenever head or sombrero showed itself along the heights. Then
      came shots from the rear, and another poor fellow was laid low, and
      Edwards realized, to his despair, that the bandits were on every side, and
      the result only a question of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;then, there came a thunder of hoof beats, a storm of
      ringing cheers, a rush and whirl of panting, foaming steeds and a score of
      sunburnt, stalwart troopers racing in the lead of a tall young soldier,
      whose voice rang clear above the tumult: &ldquo;Dismount! Up the rocks, men!
      Lively now!&rdquo; And, springing from his own steed, leaping catlike from rock
      to rock, Phil Adriance went tearing up the heights, his soldiers at his
      heels. Edwards and his unwounded men seized and held the trembling horses;
      Sherrick feebly crawled to his precious safe and fell across it, his arms
      clasping about his iron charge. For five minutes more there was a clamor
      of shots and shouts, once in a while a wild Mexican shriek for mercy, all
      the tumult gradually receding in the distance, and at last&mdash;silence.
      Then two men came down the bluffs, half bearing between them the limp form
      of their young leader. The lieutenant was shot through both thighs and was
      faint from loss of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has no one a little whiskey?&rdquo; asked Corporal Watts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are&rdquo; was the answer. And Mr. Staines, with very white face,
      stepped down from behind the ledge and held out his flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later the lieutenant lay convalescing at Rawlins' camp. A vigorous
      constitution and the healthful, bracing, open-air life he had led for
      several years, either in the saddle or tramping over the mountains, had
      enabled him to triumph speedily over such minor ills as flesh wounds, even
      though the loss of blood had been very great. The young soldier was soon
      able to give full particulars of his chase, and to one man alone, Rawlins,
      the secret of its inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most important had been the results. It was evident to everyone who
      examined the ground&mdash;and Rawlins had scoured the range with one
      platoon of his troop that very afternoon after the fight, while his
      lieutenant, Mr. Lane, was chasing the fugitives with another&mdash;that a
      band of at least twenty outlaws had been concealed among the rocks of
      Canyon del Muerto for two or three days, evidently for the purpose of
      waylaying the escort of the paymaster when he came along. Their horses had
      been concealed half a mile away in a deep ravine, and it was in trying to
      escape to them that they had sustained their losses. Five of their number
      were shot down in full flight by Adri-ance's men, and, could they have
      caught the others, no quarter would have been given, for the men were
      infuriated by the sight of the havoc the robbers had wrought, and by the
      shooting of their favorite officer.
    </p>

    <p>
      No papers had been found on the bodies; nothing, in fact, to identify them
      with any band. All, with one exception, were Mexicans; he was a white man
      whom none of the troopers could identify, though Corporal Watts, of Troop
      B, declared he had seen him at &ldquo;Cutthroat Crossing&rdquo; the last time he went
      through there on escort duty. The others, whoever they were, rode in a
      body until they got around the range to the southward, then seemed to
      scatter over the face of the earth. Some odd things had transpired, over
      which Rawlins pondered not a little. It was Corporal Watts who brought to
      his camp at 11 o'clock the news of the desperate attempt to murder and rob
      the paymaster, and as they rode back together the corporal gave the
      captain such information as lay in his power. Lieutenant Adriance had
      &ldquo;routed out&rdquo; the detachment just at daybreak, when it was still dark, and
      saddling with the utmost haste had led away across country for the canyon,
      leaving the pack mules and a small guard at camp. &ldquo;We rode like the wind,&rdquo;
       said Watts, &ldquo;after the first few miles, and every man seemed to know just
      what to expect when at last we struck the road and saw the trail of the
      ambulance and escort. We got there just in the nick of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Sherrick&mdash;who though severely battered and bruised had no bones
      broken&mdash;was able to talk at all, he never could say enough in praise
      of Adriance and his men; but what he wanted to know was how they came to
      learn of the threatened danger. Captain Rawlins protested that it was
      &ldquo;past finding out.&rdquo; The major questioned the men, but without success, and
      as for Staines, it was remarked that his pertinacity in cross-examination
      was simply wonderful. For some reason, however, the men of B troop did not
      like the fellow and would have little to do with him. But up to the time
      that Major Sherrick was able to push ahead for Tucson it is certain that
      he had discovered nothing as to the source of the lieutenant's
      information; neither had they heard of Leon Ruiz, the night messenger.
      Staines opined that he must have been intercepted by the bandits, perhaps
      killed by them, when it was found that he was the bearer of a message to
      Captain Rawlins. After a brief chat with the lieutenant himself, one which
      the doctor did not interdict, the old troop commander sent a trusty
      sergeant with six men to scout the neighborhood of the rancho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Lane was detached to take command of Adriance's troop, which
      was sent on its way forthwith, leaving the gloomy rancho alone to sentinel
      the Gila crossing. But the moment Sherrick and his silent clerk drove on
      toward Tucson the old captain said a few words of farewell to the invalid,
      left him in the doctor's charge and rode away northward on the trail of
      his sergeant. That night he rapped for admission and ordered supper at
      Rancho Ruiz, while his men, strolling about the premises, took careful
      note of the three or four scowling &ldquo;greasers&rdquo; who infested the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adriance was sitting up and beginning to hobble around when Rawlins
      returned to camp during the week that followed, and was all eagerness to
      hear what tidings the captain had to tell. But Rawlins had little to say;
      he had seen Pedro and had had one glimpse of Senora Dolores, but not so
      much as a word with the senorita; she was kept carefully concealed. Within
      the month Adriance was quite well enough to travel to his station, but
      refused. He would remain here, he said, until able to relieve Lane of the
      command of his troop and continue the scouting work. He did not wish to go
      to the fort. Sherrick and his clerk had come back in the course of a
      fortnight, and Mr. Staines asked to see Lieutenant Adriance, but that
      gentleman refused&mdash;a matter which caused the clerk to &ldquo;bite his lips
      and look queer,&rdquo; reported the soldier who took the message, but he said
      nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days afterward a Prescott paper mentioned the fact that Mr. Albert G.
      Staines, so long and favorably known in this Territory, had dropped in to
      look over valuable mining properties in the Big Bug and Hassayampa
      districts; and this Rawlins silently showed to Adriance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may be sure he'll come down to the rancho, and in less than no
      time,&rdquo; said Adriance, &ldquo;and I must go.&rdquo; Rawlins made no reply at first,
      then he rose and nervously paced the floor a moment and turned upon his
      junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, I say no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color mounted to the lieutenant's
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask yourself; ask your conscience, Adriance. You have told her that he,
      Staines, was a liar. You have virtually told her that you were engaged to
      no woman. You have inspired a sentiment, perhaps a passion, in that young
      girl's heart, and you're going there to defend her&mdash;a thing that I
      can do much better than you, now that you are a cripple. Then, think, my
      boy, I have known you six years; I have never known you to say or do a
      mean or unmanly thing. I'm an old fogy&mdash;an old fool perhaps&mdash;but
      I like to think most women pure and some men honest. You are one of them,
      Phil.&rdquo; There was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you think I mean her harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Philip, but would you marry that old scoundrel's daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adriance had no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, if you look into that girl's eyes again, unless it be to ask her
      to be your wife, I shall lose my faith in manly honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterward Rawlins rode away on duty. A strange unrest had
      possessed the lieutenant since that brief talk with this old Puritan of a
      captain. Not another word had been said upon the subject, but every
      syllable that Rawlins spoke had struck home. Adriance respected and
      honored the grim, duty-loving troop commander whom some of the youngsters
      openly laughed at and referred to as &ldquo;Praise the Lord Barebones&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Captain Roundhead,&rdquo; but the lieutenant well knew that no braver soldier,
      no &ldquo;squar-er&rdquo; captain drew sabre in the whole regiment than this faithful
      friend, who had long since singled him out for many an unusual kindness.
      He knew more&mdash;that in his high standard of honor and rectitude old
      Rawlins had said nothing which was not just and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adriance knew well that he ought not to again seek that young girl's
      presence, and the blood rushed hotly to his cheek as he recalled the kiss
      his eager lips had stolen. Marry that old scoundrel's daughter? No, he
      could not; and yet how his pulses bounded at the thought of her&mdash;the
      sweet, shy gladness in her eyes, the soft, thrilling tones in her voice
      when she spoke his name, the heroism of her conduct in daring to seek his
      camp in the darkness of night and bring him warning of that diabolical
      scheme of robbery and murder; the refinement of her manner, and then, too,
      her knowledge of the English tongue. Where had she acquired these? What
      would she not be justified in thinking of him if he never came to seek and
      thank her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! what's that?&rdquo; was the sudden cry among the men. Two or three
      soldiers sat up in the shade and curiously inspected the coming object;
      others shouted laughing challenge. Riding solemnly forward, a little
      Mexican boy came straight to where Adriance was lying and handed him a
      note which he eagerly opened and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>They suspect me, and they send me away tomorrow. To-night I go for the
      last time to the summer house alone. Isabel.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone was every resolution at the instant; gone all hesitancy. Adriance had
      not even time to wonder at the fact that she had written to him in
      English. Leaving the note for Rawlins to read when he returned, in one
      hour Phil was rolling from the camp in the ambulance. Soon after dark,
      leaving Private Regan and another man half a mile back from the walls of
      the corral, Mr. Adriance, all alone, slowly made his way afoot toward the
      dim lights at the rancho. Making wide circuit so as not to alarm the dogs,
      he never sought to draw near the little summer house until, from the east,
      he could see the brighter lights that gleamed in the bar and card room.
      Then he cautiously approached, his heart beating quickly and his knees
      trembling a little, perhaps from weakness. Hark! Faint, soft and clear,
      there rose upon the evening air the liquid notes of a guitar. It was she
      then&mdash;it was Isabel awaiting his coming, aye, signaling softly to
      call him to her. What could it mean but that she loved and longed to see
      him? A moment more and he was at the doorway, the very spot where he had
      surprised her that well-remembered night. The plaintive tinkle of the
      guitar continued, and there in the dark corner was the dim, white-robed
      form. He could almost distinguish the folds of the graceful <i>rebosa</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel!&rdquo; he whispered. Three more steps and he would be at her side.
      Suddenly two stalwart arms were thrown about him, a broad hand was on his
      mouth, stifling the utterance of a sound; the white-robed form in front
      leaped toward him, the <i>rebosa</i> falling to the ground. It was a man's
      voice&mdash;a Mexican's&mdash;that hissed the word's: &ldquo;Quick! the pistol.&rdquo;
       Another hand was at his holster. He realized instantly that he was lured,
      trapped; that his life was threatened. He was struggling violently, but,
      weakened by his wound, even his superb physique was well nigh powerless in
      the grasp of two or three men. Suddenly there came a whisper: &ldquo;The sponge,
      the sponge!&rdquo; and then the subtle odor of chloroform on the night air. And
      now he nerved himself for one supreme effort. A quick twist of his head
      and the hand was dislodged, a finger slipping between his teeth. With all
      his strength he crushed it to the very bone, and there was a yell of pain
      and terror. Then his own brave young voice rang out in one startling,
      rallying cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Regan, help!&rdquo; Then crash and blows, the gleam of a knife, a
      rolling, rough-and-tumble struggle on the ground; then a woman's scream, a
      light, and Isabel had bounded into their midst, her mother at her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leon, my brother! In God's name, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as she spoke her startled eyes fell on Adriance, staggering to his
      feet, pale, bleeding, faint. Another instant and he went crashing back
      against the guitar that, like siren's song, had lured him. One brave leap
      and she was at his side, her arms about his neck, his pallid face pillowed
      on her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senora Dolores flew to her aid; then turning, holding her lantern on high,
      her shrill voice rang out in fury:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the monstrous work your son has wrought, Pedro Ruiz! Look! Tear
      off that mantle, senor!&rdquo; she said, whirling upon another form now slowly
      rising from the earth. &ldquo;Coward! murderer that you are! It is you who have
      ruined this boy and made him what he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! You fool! there lies your daughter's betrayer. Leon would have been
      coward indeed if he had not punished him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you lie! She never saw him alone in her life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask your son,&rdquo; was the sneering answer. &ldquo;Ask José, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was with him&mdash;in his tent&mdash;the last night he was here; I
      swear it!&rdquo; cried José.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;listen, it was but to warn him&mdash;I heard
      the plot&mdash;I heard all. I rushed to him only to tell him of the
      danger. Mother, believe me. And I dare not tell it even to you, for fear&mdash;for
      fear of him.&rdquo; And she pointed to the fierce, scowling face of the old
      Mexican, now striding forward, knife in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pedro&mdash;back! You shall not harm her! No!&rdquo; and the mother hurled
      herself before her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the way!&rdquo; was the hissing answer, &ldquo;or you, too, feel my knife. Ah,
      traitress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my God! help! There will be murder here! Pedro, husband! O, villain,
      she is not your child! You shall not kill!&rdquo; And then a piercing shriek
      rang out upon the night. But at the same instant there came the rush of
      hoofs without&mdash;a rush of panting men; a brawny trooper sprang into
      the summer house and with one blow of his revolver butt sent Pedro
      staggering into a corner, his knife falling from his nerveless hand. A
      dark, agile figure leaped for the doorway, with muttered curse. And then
      in came old Rawlins, somewhat &ldquo;blown,&rdquo; but preternaturally cool, and the
      doctor close behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring another light here, one of you men!&rdquo; And a trooper ran to the card
      room. &ldquo;Lie still there, Pedro! Blow his brains out if he moves! Doctor,
      you look to the women and Adriance. Now, where's that man Staines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some fellow ran in through here, captain,&rdquo; said a trooper. &ldquo;Corporal
      Watts is after him with Royce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it, you greaser? Speak, damn you! You were here with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonora Bill,&rdquo; said José, shaking from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came the sound of pistol shots out toward the corral, and then
      the louder bang of a cavalry carbine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Rawlins of a soldier who came running back.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we have the doctor, sir? It was Mr. Staines. He shot the corporal,
      who was chasing him, but he got a carbine bullet through the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four days afterward, lying in a little white room, Mr. Adriance listened
      to the story of Leon's confession. It was brief enough. Staines had
      acquired an ascendency over him in Tucson, and it was not difficult to
      induce him to become a confederate in every plot. It was Staines who sent
      him to Manuel and Garcia to warn them that the paymaster's ambulance would
      not reach Canyon del Muerto until morning. It was Staines who murdered
      Sergeant Dinsmore after a quarrel and then had had his throat cut and the
      body thrown into the Gila near the ranch. Staines had fallen in love with
      Isabel when she first came from Sonora, but the girl shrank from him;
      neither would she listen to Sergeant Dinsmore.
    </p>
    <p>
      After it was safe for Leon to return to the ranch, he found that his
      mother and Isabel were practically prisoners. His father was furious at
      the failure of the plan, and daily accused his wife of having, in some
      way, given warning to Adriance, and swore that he would have the blood of
      the man or woman who had betrayed the scheme; and then Staines himself
      came back and wrung from José that he had seen Isabel scurrying from
      Adri-ance's tent at daybreak, and so denounced her to Leon as the mistress
      of an accursed Gringo. Staines wrote the note that was to lure Adriance to
      the bower, where Leon was to take the guitar and <i>rebosa</i> and the
      two, with José's help, were to overpower him. It was his life or theirs
      said Staines. Pedro was not in the project, for he had prohibited
      bloodshed about the place&mdash;&ldquo;It would ruin his business&rdquo; he said. But
      both Pedro and Leon were now in irons, and Rawlins' troop was in camp
      around gloomy old Rancho Ruiz.

    <p>
      A day or two later he heard another story, this time from the lips of
      Senora Dolores herself: Isabel was not the daughter of Pedro Ruiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sobs and tears the poor, broken woman told her tale. She had been
      married when quite a young girl to Senor Moreno, an officer of distinction
      in the Mexican army. Her brave husband made her life a happy one, and the
      birth of the little daughter strengthened the ties that bound them. Alas!
      Moreno, colonel of lancers, was killed before Queretaro; and in two years
      more the widow, with her winsome little girl, had not where to lay her
      head. It was in the city of Mexico that Senora Dolores then met Ruiz, a
      widower with an only son, prosperous and apparently respected. He promised
      to educate Isabel and provide for her as his own, and sought the widow as
      his wife. For a time all went well; then she learned his true character.
      He was compelled to leave the city and flee up the coast to Mazatlan,
      while she remained with little Isabel, who was being educated at the
      convent. At last they had to join him at Hermosillo, whence he was soon
      after driven to Tucson. Their lives were wrecked by his scoundrelism. Her
      papers clearly established the truth of her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One soft, still evening, not a week after the tragic events of that rueful
      night, Captain Rawlins sat by the lieutenant's side, reading aloud some
      letters just received from department headquarters. Major Sherrick had
      been in a state of dismay ever since the news of the death of Staines had
      reached him, but his dismay changed to wonderment, even gratitude, as he
      learned the true character of the man. It was Sonora Bill himself, beyond
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a blessing you left that note for me to see!&rdquo; said Rawlins. &ldquo;How
      came it you never saw it was a forgery, Phil? Had she never written to you
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a line, nor have I seen her to thank her. By Heaven, Rawlins! why
      am I forbidden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not&mdash;now, Phil,&rdquo; was the smiling answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps an hour later, Adriance limped slowly out of the room and down the
      narrow passageway to the side door. Yonder stood the little summer house
      &ldquo;in the gloaming,&rdquo; and he was right&mdash;he had heard women's voices
      there&mdash;Dolores and her daughter. There were tears in the maiden's
      words, and he could not withstand the longing of his heart. He would have
      hobbled thither, but suddenly there came the sound of rustling skirt and a
      tiny footfall. It was she&mdash;his dark-eyed, dark-haired sweetheart,
      hastening toward him, her face hidden in her hands. One instant more and
      he had torn the hands away and had clasped her to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel! darling! I have found you at last! No, you shall not go&mdash;you
      shall not until you promise&mdash;promise to be my wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, senor, you cannot&mdash;you do not mean it,&rdquo; she sobbed, Struggling to
      be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not mean it! Why, sweet one, you do not dream how I love you&mdash;how
      I long for you! Not mean it? Isabel, look in my eyes. Look for yourself.&rdquo;
       He laughed low and happily. He was brimming over with hope and gladness,
      for now at last without a struggle she nestled on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his grizzled beard old Rawlins was best man when that strange,
      very quiet, yet very happy wedding came off in the Old Mission Church at
      Tucson early in the spring. Pedro was not there to give the bride away.
      With considerable escort and much reluctance he had traversed &ldquo;Cutthroat
      Crossing&rdquo; some months before. He went to Yavapai, and Yavapai&mdash;we
      have his own words for it&mdash;was &ldquo;too damn close to 'ell.&rdquo; The rancho
      passed within the year to other hands. It, too, had taken on another name&mdash;a
      grewsome one&mdash;<i>Rancho del Muerto</i>.

      unacquainted with the joys of the chase would be surprised if told, as he
      sauntered through some city market, that there was far more pleasure in
      hunting those plump little brown birds hanging in bunches around the
      stalls than in pursuing that imposing beast whose antlers reach the
      pavement. Yet it would be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deer hunting under its usual conditions leaves something, often much, to
      be desired. If a dozen men are placed on isolated &ldquo;stands&rdquo; the solitary
      hours of waiting are long and weary. And should you happen to be a tyro
      the knowing ones hide you away in some unlikely spot, where hardly by any
      possibility will the chance come to you of seeing and, in the shivers of
      &ldquo;buck ague,&rdquo; missing the game. &ldquo;Still hunting,&rdquo; another mode, is well
      named. As a rule it may be depended upon to afford no end of stillness,
      and little else. And to be rowed up by a hired guide on a lake to within a
      few feet of a poor, helpless buck, swimming for dear life, and blow out
      his brains is almost as bad as shooting pheasants in an English preserve
      or poultry in a barnyard. Under all these methods deer hunting lacks what
      is the conspicuous charm of partridge (quail) shooting&mdash;vivid and
      continuous excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, from the moment when you enter, on a sparkling autumn morning, a
      brown stubble field, fresh of limb and eager for the fray, till you limp
      back at sunset, wolfish for dinner, and broken with a delicious fatigue,
      you have not had one dull moment. You may not have been firing steadily;
      the birds may even have been a little scarce; but every instant of the
      day, as you have watched your dogs sweeping to and fro, you have been
      buoyed up by an ever lively hope that the next moment your heart will be
      gladdened by seeing them halt&mdash;frozen as it were&mdash;in their
      tracks. Ah, there they are! You hurry up, you and your friend, breathing
      short. Up bursts the brown covey, with startling buzz! You bang away&mdash;innocuously
      it may be, but no matter, you have made a prodigious noise, at any rate&mdash;that's
      some comfort. And see now! The little brown balls have dropped into the
      weeds, one here, one there, along the ditch, and a little bunch, all
      together, in that clump of briars on the hillside. Better luck next time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, after all, &ldquo;Bob White,&rdquo; for all his bustle, is but a small chap. It
      would take hundreds, nay, bushels of him, to outweigh one &ldquo;antlered
      monarch.&rdquo; Toothsome though he be (on toast) he tips the scales at a
      beggarly half pound. On the other hand, it often takes you a week or so to
      get one chance at a deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happens that it was once my fortune to take part in a deer
      hunt, where the excitement was as continuous as that in a stubble field,
      and, naturally, far more intense. This was years ago, and in Scott County,
      Mississippi, two days' journey on horseback from our plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every November, as a child, I had eagerly hailed the return from the camp
      hunt of the big four-mule wagon, laden with tents, cooking utensils and
      provisions, and upon which were piled high the noble bucks and sleek does.
      At last, when I had reached the age of sixteen, the longed-for permission
      was granted me, and one crisp, frosty morning my father and I mounted our
      horses and set out for Scott County, followed by Beverly and the great
      covered wagon. Both Beverly and Ned, his whitish-gray saddle mule, had
      their peculiarities, as will appear later.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we journeyed on we were joined at successive cross roads by others of
      our hunting party, and when we reached the ground we numbered, with those
      already arrived by other routes, about fifteen. The tents were soon
      pitched and a roaring fire of logs six feet long was sending up its merry
      sparks into the starry vault above us. Would supper never be ready?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the tents flashed in the fire light, the ruddy glow of which
      battled with the hosts of darkness that advanced upon us under cover of
      the primeval, mysterious forest that surrounded us far and wide. And that
      forest teeming with deer and wolves. Oh, how delightful! And my Latin
      grammar miles and miles away! And dust accumulating on my arithmetic!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where is Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detained by business; he will join us in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! A hunt without Billy Blount is no hunt at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mere mention of his name every eye brightened. Mr. Blount had more
      than one peculiarity, all of them pleasant. He was just one of those
      mortals whom mothers in their fatuity christen William. If ever there was
      a man born with an inalienable right to be called Billy it was he. A
      stranger meeting him in the road would know by intuition that that was his
      name. His twinkling eye suggested it. His ruddy brown dimpled cheek, his
      breadth of smile proclaimed it, and when he laughed every well-lined rib
      shouted aloud, &ldquo;Our name is Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was not with us; so the next best thing was to tell stories of his
      exploits. To these I listened with wide-eyed delight. I will give one as a
      sample. But that it may be understood, it will be necessary to show
      beforehand the very unusual method of hunting that obtained in Scott
      County.
    </p>
    <p>
      That portion of Mississippi was in those days almost uninhabited and was
      covered by a forest&mdash;it would be almost correct to call it a grove&mdash;of
      post oaks, beneath which grew waist high underbrush. The oaks which
      covered the ground almost to the exclusion of other trees stood so far
      apart that one had an outlook of perhaps a couple of hundred yards in
      every direction, so that a good rider could gallop in comfort along the
      open spaces. This tree bears a small but sweet nutritious acorn; hence the
      great store of deer that frequented these forests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being the nature of the ground the chase is conducted as follows: The
      hunters throw themselves into a skirmish line at intervals of sixty or
      eighty yards. In the centre rides the leader of the hunt with a compass
      fixed upon the pommel of his saddle. The line advances through the woods
      due north, let us say, for a few hours; then wheels at right angle and
      moves east; then south, then west&mdash;back to camp, venison steaks and
      wild turkey; for, in the interests of better fare, it was permitted to
      knock over a gobbler if he were too hospitably saucy to get out of the
      way. The deer were not equally abundant year after year. Occasionally it
      was found that &ldquo;black tongue&rdquo; had worked havoc among them since the
      preceding hunt. But they were always numerous enough to maintain a
      continuous and intense glow of expectation in the breast of every hunter.
      As a rule you rode straight ahead, swerving neither to the right nor the
      left, every nerve on the alert, from sunrise till' sunset. But if you saw
      a little out of your path an upturned tree you bent your course toward it,
      your heart in your mouth. I have known as many as seven deer to bound
      forth from the brown-leaved &ldquo;lap&rdquo; of one fallen oak. But at any moment
      during the day you were liable to be startled by a buck springing up out
      of the undergrowth, often from beneath the very feet of your horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only an inexperienced hunter would ask: &ldquo;Why not shoot them where they
      lie?&rdquo; You do not know they are there. The detective eye that can make out
      the form of a deer crouched down on a bed of brown leaves and veiled with
      a fringe of underbrush is given to few. Among these favored ones was our
      friend Billy. It was generally believed in camp that he shot most of his
      game in their beds. Billy himself was at no pains, of course, to spread
      this view. In his highly-illustrated accounts of his achievements the
      quarry was always going like the wind; he had not been sure, in fact, what
      he fired at; he saw a brown flash, that was all; banged away, and down
      came that thumping buck. Never was so surprised in his life; thought it
      was a hawk or something. But this is the story of Mr. Jennings, brother of
      the leader of the hunt: &ldquo;Blount rides on my right, and I don't know how I
      shall get on without him, even for a day or two. However, I may live
      longer if he is not there, for he sows his buckshot broadcast. Three years
      ago&mdash;I never knew the deer so thick as they were that season&mdash;happening
      to look in his direction, I saw him dismounting with an agility that was
      surprising considering his 225 pounds. He halted me with an eager wave of
      his hand and began advancing on tiptoe; every fibre of his vast form
      tense, his eyes riveted upon some object in front, finger on trigger.
      Barely had he crept forward ten yards when up sprang a buck hardly twenty
      feet in front of him and darted to the rear, between Blount and me.
      Instantly, without once removing his eyes from the game upon which he was
      stealing, he whirled his gun to the right and pulled the trigger. The buck
      passed on, while twigs and bark rained on me from the whizzing buckshot.
      Would you believe it?&mdash;but you all know him&mdash;not a moment did he
      halt or once remove his eyes from whatever it was that had fascinated his
      gaze in front. He still danced forward, light as an Indian, with eyes
      starting from their sockets. Presently up jumps a doe. She, too, bounded
      to the rear, but on Blount's left this time. Again, with his staring eyes
      still glued to the something in front&mdash;bang! 'What in the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      are you about?' roared Parrish from Blount's left; 'you will be shooting
      somebody the first thing you know. Here is one of your crazy shot through
      my hat.' To all which our wild man paid not the least attention.
      'Jennings! Jennings! come here! come here! come here! quick! quick! quick!
      For God's sake, man, hurry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dismounted and ran up to him. 'There! there! give it to him! Good Lord,
      man, can't you see him? There, in that lap!' I strained my eyes in vain. I
      could see nothing. 'Why, don't you see him turning his head? He is looking
      at us! My Lord, Jennings, gimme the gun! gimme the gun! gimme the gun!'
      Just as I did so a noble buck sprang from the lap and bounded off. Blount
      drew down upon him. Bound after bound, and still Blount did not fire,
      though he seemed to be pulling away for dear life at the triggers.
      Presently the deer, passing behind a clump of trees, disappeared. I
      carried my gun at half cock. This Blount did not know or remember. He bent
      both my triggers. Any other man might very well have bagged all three deer
      with such a chance. And what do you suppose he then said? 'At any rate, I
      laid out two of the rascals. Come, Jennings, help me find 'em.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dogs were not used on these hunts. Two or three trusty old hounds, it is
      true, hung about the heels of our leader's horse, but they were employed
      only in running down badly-wounded animals. For the first day or so these
      dogs were hard to control, so rich was the scent that met their nostrils
      at every turn; but after the third day they grew too <i>blasé</i> to take
      any interest in any trail not sprinkled with blood. We had a number of
      horn signals. If a gun was heard, followed by a long blast (every man wore
      a horn), the line halted. A deer had been killed in its tracks. A second
      blast indicated that the quarry had been strapped behind the saddle of the
      lucky man; and once more the line moved forward. But if three or four
      short, excited toots, mingled with shouts, rang out upon the frosty air, a
      wounded deer was being pursued, and the leader of the hunt galloped up,
      followed by his little pack, who soon pulled down the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all my boasting about the abundance of deer in these post-oak
      forests the reader is, I dare say, prepared to learn that with a party of
      fifteen the spoil of a ten-days hunt would be one thousand head at the
      very least. Great will be his surprise therefore to learn that at the
      close of our first day's hunt we returned to camp without one solitary
      buck or doe to show to our disgusted cooks. Never had the game been so
      scarce, and yet not a man of us all had the same loads in his gun with
      which he had sallied gaily forth full of hope in the morning. One fine
      buck alone had emptied just thirty barrels for us. Flushed on the extreme
      right, he had bounded along in front of the whole line, a trifle out of
      range, perhaps, and each one of us had given him a roaring double salute.
      As the rolling thunder approached me I almost ceased to breathe. What were
      conjugations and declensions and rules of three compared with this! It was
      like a battle, as I have since discovered, with the notable difference
      that our side made all the noise, and the deer did not shoot back. But
      none of us had been able, in the language of Mr. Sam Weller's Dick Turpin
      ditty, to &ldquo;prewail upon him for to stop.&rdquo; Other shots at other deer all of
      us had, but we supped on bacon that evening.

      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE who has never
      tried the experiment can have no idea how easy it is to miss when firing
      from horseback at a buck who sends your heart up into your mouth by
      springing up from beneath your horse's heels, and then speeds away,
      twisting and turning among the boles of the trees. Men who could bring
      down a partridge with each barrel have been known to shoot away half a bag
      of shot before they began to get the hang of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shades of evening were falling. Humiliating though it was, we had
      fallen, too, with a will on our gameless supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-t! Listen! What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We pricked up our ears. Presently there came softly echoing from far away
      in the forest a long-drawn cry, ringing, melodious, clear as a bugle call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The welkin rang with our joyous shouts. Half our party sprang to their
      feet and red-hot coffee splashed from tin cups. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Billy got the keenest holler I ever hear!&rdquo; chuckled Beverly. &ldquo;Bound
      he fetch luck 'long wid him! No mo' bacon for supper arter dis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We craned our necks to catch the first glimpse of our mascot. Obviously,
      from the direction of the joyous yells with which he answered our
      welcoming shouts, he had abandoned the road and was riding straight
      through the open woods. Presently we descried through the deepening
      twilight his portly form looming up atop a tall gray. Then two vivid
      flashes and two loud reports, followed by a mad rush of the gray, which
      came tearing down on us in wild terror, and for a minute we were treated
      to something like an amateur episode from one of Mr. Buffalo Bill's
      entertainments. Amid roars of laughing welcome the ponderous knight was at
      last helped down from his trembling steed, whose bridle Beverly had been
      able luckily to snatch as he floundered among the tent ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where the deuce did you pick up that wild beast? Surely you can't
      expect to shoot from him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll cool him down in a day or two; he'll soon get used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact a horse who dreads a gun gets more and more terror
      stricken as the hunt goes on, the mere sight of a deer, the cocking of a
      gun even, sufficing to set him off into plungings that grow day by day
      more violent. This none should have known better than Blount; for never,
      by any chance, did he ride to the hunt with an animal that would &ldquo;stand
      fire.&rdquo; The discharge of his gun, the rise of a buck even, was always the
      opening of a circus with him. But he managed invariably to let off both
      barrels&mdash;one perhaps through the tree tops, the other into the
      ground. In one particular alone was he provident. He brought always so
      immense a supply of ammunition that toward the close of the hunt his tent
      was a supply magazine to the less thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Blount, &ldquo;not a single one! Ah! boys, that was because I
      was not with you.&rdquo; The jovial soul had not a trace of conceit; he was
      merely sanguine&mdash;contagiously, gloriously, magnificently sanguine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but won't we knock 'em over tomorrow!&rdquo; And straightway we lifted up
      our hearts and had faith in this prophet of pleasant things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly, will that mule Ned stand fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno, Marse Billy; nobody ain't nebber tried him. But I 'spec' you
      wouldn't ax him no odds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go and have a look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterward we heard two tremendous explosions, followed by a
      frenzied clatter of hoofs and the sound of breaking branches, and up there
      came, running and laughing, a Monsieur Wynen, a Belgian violinist, a real
      artist, who was one of our party (though never a trigger did he pull
      during the entire hunt).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynen was first violin in an opera troupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only Blount rehearsing Ned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any man in the world except Blount would have tested that demure wheel
      mule's views as to firearms by firing off his gun in his neighborhood as
      he stood tethered. Not so Billy. Mounting the guileless and unsuspecting
      Ned, and casting the reins upon his bristly neck, he had let drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shocked beyond expression by the dreadful roar and flash (it was now
      night) Ned had made a mad rush through the woods. In vain; for Blount had
      a good seat. Then had there come into Ned's wily brain the reminiscence of
      a trick that he had never known to fail in thirty years. He stopped
      suddenly, still as a gate post, at the same time bracing his vertebrae
      into the similitude of a barrel hoop, and instantly Blount lay sprawling
      upon his jolly back; and there was a second roar, followed by a rush of
      buckshot among the leaves and around the legs of the audience that was
      watching the rehearsal. &ldquo;Never mind, Jack,&rdquo; said he to me, shortly
      afterward, &ldquo;I'll find something that will stand fire&rdquo; and throwing his arm
      around my shoulder for a confidential talk of the slaughter he was to do
      on the morrow, his sanguine soul bubbled into my sympathetic ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Jack, don't tell the boys; but I have got two bags of shot. They
      would laugh, of course. Now, how many ought a fellow to bring down with
      two bags? I mean a cool-headed chap who does not lose his head. How does
      one dozen to the bag strike you? Reasonable? H'm? Of course. Twenty-four,
      then. Well, let us say twenty-five, just to round off things. Golly! Why,
      nine is the highest score I ever made. Twenty-five! Why, that is a quarter
      of a hundred. Did you notice that? Whee-ew! The boys will stop bedeviling
      me after that, h'm? I should say so. Not a rascal of them all ever killed
      so many. Cool and steady, that's the thing, my boy. Up he jumps! What of
      that? Don't be flustered, I tell you. Count ten. Then lower your gun.
      There is not the least hurry in the world. Drop the muzzle on his side,
      just behind his shoulder. Steady! Let him think you are not after deer
      this morning. If it is a doe let it appear that you are loaded for buck.
      Bang! Over he tumbles in his tracks. You load up and are off again. Up
      hops another&mdash;a beauty. Same tactics&mdash;boo-doo-ee! Got him!
      What's the sense of throwing away your shot? Costs money&mdash;delays the
      line. Cool&mdash;cool and steady&mdash;that's the word, my boy. Get any
      shots to-day? Three? Hit anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too dark for him to see how pale I went at this question. &ldquo;Mr.
      Blount,&rdquo; said I, with a choking in my throat (nobody could help telling
      the big-hearted fellow everything), &ldquo;you won't tell my father, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, he cautioned me over and over again never, under any
      circumstances, to fire at a deer that ran toward a neighboring huntsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not&mdash;never!&rdquo; echoed Blount with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-day&mdash;and to-day, when I was not thinking of such a thing, a
      big buck jumped up from right under my horse's belly, and did you notice
      that gray-headed old gentleman by the fire? Well, the buck rushed straight
      toward him&mdash;and I forgot all about what my father had said and banged
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you pepper him?&rdquo; put in Billy eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pepper him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, he went on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will do it, occasionally, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw the leaves raining down on the old gentleman, my heart stopped
      beating. You will not tell my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! There was no harm done. We must trust to Providence in these
      matters. What did the old gentleman say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word; it was his first campaign, too. His eyes were nearly popping
      out of his head. He let off both barrels. The shot whistled around me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old fool! He ought to know better. To-morrow your father must put you
      next to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blount brought us hilarity and hope, but no luck, at any rate at first.
      When we rode slowly into camp on the following day, just as the sun went
      down, we had one solitary doe to show. Blount&mdash;Blount of all men&mdash;had
      killed it. The servants hung it up on one of the poles that remained from
      year to year stretched against the neighboring trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to Blount's weight his game was always strapped behind some less
      lucky huntsman; so we had had no opportunity of examining his riddled
      quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how is this?&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Oh, I remember; the other side was
      toward me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went around to the other side. Had the doe died of fright? After much
      searching we found one bullet hole just behind the shoulder. Blount always
      put four extra bullets into his load. So he had showered down forty
      buckshot upon a doe lying in her bed at a distance of twenty feet and
      struck her with one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Jack, for the Lord's sake don't tell the boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After these two days our luck improved, and at the end of the hunt our
      score reached seventy-eight; the smallest number, by the way, that the
      club had ever killed. It would hardly be interesting to go into the
      details of each day's sport, but our hero's adventures one night seem
      worth recording. To this joyous and indefatigable spirit the day was all
      too short. No sooner had he eaten his supper each day than he began to
      importune the younger men of the party to join him in a &ldquo;fire hunt;&rdquo; but,
      as they were not Blounts, they felt that a long day in the saddle was
      enough. In his despair Blount turned to Beverly. That amiable creature,
      not knowing how to refuse the request of a white gentmun, assented, but
      with a quaking heart, for were not the surrounding forests swarming with
      ravenous wolves? He had often lain awake and listened complacently enough
      to their howling, but to trust, to thrust, himself wantonly among them at
      dead of night!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wid nobody along but Marse Billy Blount, an' he couldn't hit nothin',
      even by daylight, onless dey asleep. He hear 'em say wolf 'fraid o' fire.
      Maybe he is. But lights draws dem wild varmints, an' 'sposin' arter a
      whole congregation un 'em done come up starin' at de light; 'sposin'
      somehow or nuther de torch got out&mdash;whar Beverly den? Marse Billy got
      de gun; but whar Beverly? Ain't I hear people say wolf more ambitiouser
      for nig-gar dan for sheep meat? Howsomever, ef my own mahster willin' to
      resk losin' of me, I can stand it, I reckon. But Tom, ef you should wake
      up, and hear something coming through de bresh like a drove o' steers, you
      needn't ax what dat; it's me and de wolves a-makin' for camp; an' me in
      the lead, wid de help o' de Laud.&rdquo; Sitting in front of the blazing logs
      and chatting with his fellow cooks, Beverly could see the humor of his
      quite real fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, then, the burly knight and his dusky and not over-valiant squire
      setting forth in quest of adventure&mdash;the one mounted on his tall
      gray, the other astraddle of Ned. It appears incredible that any man in
      his senses would take two such ani-malson such an expedition, but there
      never was but one Blount. Beverly carried the gun, his chief the torch,
      consisting of &ldquo;lightwood&rdquo; knots blazing in the bowl of a long-handled
      frying pan. The handle, resting on the right shoulder, was held somewhat
      depressed, so that the light should shine above the head of the huntsman,
      illumining the woods in his front. The sportsman, slowly waving the handle
      to and fro, peers intently into the darkness in quest of the gleaming eyes
      of some staring buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a dismal howl from far away to the right came stealing through
      the silence. And presently an answering cry from the left, and much
      nearer. And another, and another! <i>Ugh! what was that?</i> A rabbit had
      darted under Ned, across the rattling leaves. Beverly, shivering, dug his
      heels into Ned's ribs. Ned pressed forward till his nose touched the
      ticklish flank of the gray. The gray let fly with whizzing hoof. Ned shut
      his eyes, unwilling to witness the enormity of an aged mule being kicked
      at by torchlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly! Beverly!&rdquo; breathed the knight eagerly, &ldquo;gimme the gun! gimme the
      gun! I see a pair of eyes as big as saucers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&mdash;M&mdash;Marse B&mdash;B&mdash;Billy&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! gimme the gun! What the devil is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De wolves, Marse Billy! 'Sposin' arter de gun done empty dey splunge in
      upon us? I bound a whole nation un 'em watchin' us dis minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blount wrested the gun from the reluctant Beverly, whose knee now trembled
      against his. Pressing down the pan handle so as to throw the light well in
      front, he cocked the gun, adjusted it to his shoulder, took aim, and
      pulled the trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blount, in reply to the warning of his friends, had urged that it might
      very well be that a horse that shied by day at a gun would act differently
      at night. And he was right. By daylight the gray was in the habit of
      making one or two violent plunges when his rider fired. But tonight, when
      that terrible roar broke the stillness and that fierce blaze flashed into
      his eyes&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the sound of the gun reached us we heard the anxious,
      jolting bray of a trotting mule. The disjointed, semi-asinine song came
      nearer, and presently Ned hurried past the fire to his place by his
      tethered mate, with a low equine chuckle of satisfaction. In his wake
      rushed Beverly, panting, wide eyed. It was a full minute before he could
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, mahsters, don't ax me nothin'; I don't know nothin' 'bout it. I
      'most don't know whether I here or no arter de way dem revengious varmints
      whoop me through dem woods, a-yelpin' an' a-gnash-in' o' deir teeth. B'fo'
      Gaud, I thought every minute was gwine to be my next! When Marse Billy
      shoot, though I beg him not to, seein' dat de whole woods was a-bilin' wid
      wolves, dat fool of a horse o' hisn jess riz on his hind legs an' splunge
      right over me an' Ned, jess like we warn't nothin't all. Dem lightwood
      knots flew right up, same as one o' dem blaze o' glories I see when I got
      religion. I lit on my head. Ned he went oneway; Marse Billy horse anudder.
      But seein' as I done knowed Ned de longest, I followed him&mdash;an' he
      fotch me home. Run? No, twarnt runnin', twas flyin'; an' every jump de
      varmints was a-reachin' for me. I hear deir teeth, jess as plain, clashin'
      like sheep shears. Umgh-umgh! Beverly hump heself he did. Jess look at my
      clothes! I left de rest of 'em on de bushes. Whar Marse Billy? Lord
      a-mussy, I dunno! I mighty 'fraid de wolves done got him, leastwise ef he
      didn't set hard on dat dere fool gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahster, couldn't you gimme jess a leetle tetch o' dat whiskey? I'se
      powerful downhearted. Thank you, mahster. But mahster, don't lemme go no
      mo' a spotin' along o' Marse Billy; seem like I ain't dat kind. Lemme
      drive my mules, lemme cook, don't lemme go projickin' about wid Marse
      Billy Blount no mo'. You laughin', is you, Tom? Nemmind&mdash;you go next
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently there came to us from far away a doleful yell, with nothing of
      the bugle blast in it. &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; and we made response with
      laughter-choked shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fifteen minutes afterward the sound of hoofs was heard, and
      presently our mighty hunter appeared, but <i>quantum mutatus ab illo!</i>
      No hat, no gun, one skirt of his coat and half of the buttons gone; shirt
      bosom torn out, trousers hanging in ribbons! But though his face was
      scratched beyond recognition he remained the one, only true Blount in the
      world; though his eyes were bloodshot they beamed with conscious victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which of you will go and help me bring him in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring what in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the buck&mdash;I blew his infernal head off, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Blount and Beverly rode to the scene of their exploit, and
      Blount secured his gun and Beverly his frying pan. 'The buck had either
      walked off without his head or been swallowed by one of the varmints.

    <p>
      HERE was a sound of merriment on Farmer Bagley's place. It was &ldquo;corn
      shucking&rdquo; night, and the young people from all sides had met to partake of
      mirth and hospitality. After all had taken seats in the large sitting room
      and parlor, the men were invited with a mysterious wink and grin from the
      countenance of jovial Bagley to taste the contents of a large brown jug
      which smiled on a shelf beside the water bucket out in the entry. Its
      saturated corn-cob stopper, lying whiskey colored in the moonlight by the
      side of the jug, gave a most tempting aroma to the crisp, invigorating
      November air and rendered Bagley's signs and hints all the more
      comprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were mostly young men who, with clattering boots, filed out to the
      shelf and turned, with smacking lips wiped on their hands, back to the
      clusters of shy, tittering maidens round the blazing log fires. They wore
      new jean trousers neatly folded round muscular calves and stowed away,
      without a visible wrinkle, into high, colored-topped boots with sharp,
      brightly-polished heels, upon which were strapped clanking spurs. Their
      sack coats, worn without vests over low-necked woolen shirts, fitted their
      strong bodies admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Martin, a tall, well-built young man with marked timidity in his
      voice, considerably augmented by the brightness of Melissa Bagley's eyes,
      drew near that young lady and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yore pap has certainly got some o' the best corn licker in this county,
      Melissa; it liter'ly sets a feller on fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ashamed, Dick Martin!&rdquo; she answered, with a cautious glance around her
      as if she feared that someone would observe the flush that had risen into
      her pretty face as he approached. &ldquo;Be ashamed o' yorese'f fur techin'
      licker; last log-rollin' you 'lowed you'd tuk yore last dram. Paw ort to
      be churched fur settin' temptation 'fore so many young men. Ef I had my
      way the' wouldn't be a still, wild cat nur licensed, in the Co-hutta
      Mountains nowhar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, Melissa!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick. &ldquo;Don't git yore dander up 'bout
      nothin'. I'm that anxious to git yore pap on my side I'd drink slop,
      mighty high, ef he 'uz to ax me. He don't like me, an' blame me ef I know
      why, nuther. I ain't been here in the last three Sunday nights 'thout him
      a-callin' you to bed most 'fore dark. He didn't raise no objections to
      Bill Miller a-stayin' tell 'leven o'clock last Tuesday night. Oh, I ain't
      blind to hurt! Bill owns his own land and I havn't a shovelful; thar's the
      difference. He's a-comin' now, but mind you I'm agwine to set by you at
      shuckin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bright flush which had added such beauty to the girl's face vanished
      as Bill Miller swaggered up and said with a loud voice, as he roughly
      shook her hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meliss', kin I wait on you at shuckin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick's jest this minute axed me,&rdquo; she stammered, beginning to blush anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he ain't axed to set on both sides uv you, I reckon. You'd be a
      uncommon quar pusson ef the' wuz jest one side to you. What's to keep me
      frum settin' on tother side frum Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this the farmer's daughter made no reply, and as the guests were now
      starting to the barnyard she was escorted between the two rivals to the
      great coneshaped heap of unhusked corn gleaming in the pale moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All keep yore feet an' form a ring round the pile!&rdquo; called out Bagley, so
      as to be overheard above the sound of their voices. &ldquo;The' ain't no r'al
      fun 'thout everything is conducted fa'r and squar'. Now&rdquo; (as all the
      merrymakers stood hand in hand round the corn heap, Dick with one of
      Melissa's hands in his tight clasp and his rival with the other)&mdash;&ldquo;now,
      all march round an' somebody start 'King William Wuz King James' Son,' an'
      when I tell you to halt set down right whar' you are. I'm a-doin' this
      'kase at Wade's last week some fellers hid red yeers o' corn nigh the'r
      places an' wuz etarnally a-kissin' o' the gals, which ain't fa'r nur
      decent. The rule on this occasion shall be as common, in regard to the
      fust feller that finds a red yeer o'corn bein' 'lowed to kiss any gal he
      likes, but atter that one time&mdash;understand everybody&mdash;atter that
      no bussin' kin take place, red yeer ur no red yeer. I advocate moderation
      in all things, especially whar' a man an' woman's mouth is con-sarned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the musical tones of the familiar song were rising, and the straw
      beneath the feet of the human chain was rustling, Bagley called aloud the
      word: &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; and all sat down immediately and went to work with a will.
      Song after song was sung. The hard, pearly silk-tipped ears of corn flew
      through the air and rained into the crib near at hand, and billows of
      husks rolled up behind the eager workers and were raked away by negroes
      who were not permitted to take part in the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a red un, by hunky!&rdquo; yelled out a sunburnt, downy-faced youth,
      standing up and holding aloft a small ear of blood-red corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on thar!&rdquo; shouted Bagley in commanding tones. &ldquo;The rules must be
      enforced to the letter. Jim Lash, ef yore yeer measures full six inches
      ye're the lucky man, but ef it falls short o' that size its a nubbin an'
      don't count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An eager group encircled the young man, but soon a loud laugh rose and
      they all fell back into their places, for the ear had proved to be only
      five inches in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yit, Jimmy Lash; not yit,&rdquo; grunted Dick Martin, as he raked an armful
      of unhusked corn into his and Melissa's laps. Then to Melissa in an
      undertone: &ldquo;Ef wishin' 'u'd do any good, I'd be the fust to run acrost
      one, fur, by jingo! the' ain't a livin' man, Melissa, that could want it
      as bad as I do with you a-settin' so handy. By glory! [aloud] here she is,
      as red as sumac an' as long as a rollin' pin. The Lord be praised!&rdquo; He had
      risen to his feet and stood holding up the trophy for Bagley's inspection,
      fairly aglow with triumph and exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rustling in the corn husks ceased. All eyes were directed upon the
      erect forms of Dick Martin and Farmer Bagley. The clear moonlight revealed
      an unpleasant expression on the older man's face in vivid contrast to the
      cast of the younger's. Bagley seemed rather slow to form a decision; all
      present suspected the cause of his hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair's fair, Bagley!&rdquo; called out an old farmer outside of the circle.
      &ldquo;Don't belittle yorese'f by 'lowin' anything o' a personal natur' to come
      in an' influence you ag'in right. Dick Martin's the fust an' is entitled
      to the prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yore right, Wilson,&rdquo; admitted Bagley, with his eyes downcast. &ldquo;Dick
      Martin is the winner an' kin proceed; howsomever, thar's some things that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Salute yore bride an' kiss her sweet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now you may rise upon yore feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      sang the leader of the singers, completely drowning the remainder of
      Bagley's sentence. As quick as a flash of lightning Dick had thrown his
      arm round struggling Melissa and imprinted a warm kiss on her lips. Then
      the workers applauded vociferously, and Melissa sat, suffused with
      crimson, between sullen Bill Miller and beaming Dick Martin. Bagley showed
      plainly that Dick's action and the applause of all had roused his dislike
      for Dick even deeper than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm knowed to be a man o' my word,&rdquo; he fumed, white in the face and
      glancing round the ring of upturned faces. &ldquo;I'm firm as firm kin be, I
      mought say as the rock o' Bralty, when I take a notion. I've heerd a
      leetle o' the talk in this settlement 'mongst some o' the meddlin' sort,
      an' fur fear this leetle accident mought add to the'r tattle I'd jest like
      to remark that ef thar's a man on the top side o' the earth that knows
      what's to be done with his own flesh an' blood it ort to be me. What's
      been the talk ain't so, not a speck of it. I've got somethin' to say to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paw!&rdquo; expostulated Melissa, almost crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bagley&mdash;I say, Abrum Bagley, don't make a born fool o'
      yorese'f,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Bagley, as she waddled into the circle and laid
      her hand heavily upon her husband's arm. &ldquo;Now, folks, it's about time you
      wuz gittin' somethin' warm into you. You kin finish the pile atter you've
      eat. Come on, all hands, to the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shadow of mortification fell athwart Dick's honest face as soon as
      Bagley had spoken. His sensitive being was wounded to the core. As he and
      Melissa walked back to the farm house together, Bill Miller having dropped
      behind to gossip with someone over Bagley's remarks, he was silent, and
      timid Melissa was too shy to break the silence, although it was very
      painful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the entrance to the farm house, Dick held back and refused to
      enter with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you gwine to come in an' have some supper?&rdquo; Melissa asked,
      pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't a-goin' narry nuther step. Anything cooked in this house would
      stick in my throat atter what's been said. He struck me a underhanded
      lick. I won't force myse'f on 'im nur to his table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you mought, bein' as I axed you,&rdquo; said she tremblingly, as she
      shrank into the honeysuckle vines that clung to the latticework of the
      entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, blame me ef I do!&rdquo; he answered firmly. &ldquo;I'm of as good stock as
      anybody in this county; nobody cayn't run no bull yearlin' dry shod over
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Melissa could do could not induce him to join the others in the dining
      room, and when he walked angrily away she ran into her own room, and
      sitting down in the darkness alone she burst into a flood of tears. After
      supper the guests repaired again to the corn heap, but Melissa was not
      among them, and the spirits of all seemed somewhat dampened.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that night Dick Martin and Melissa Bagley did not meet each other
      for several days. However, on the Sunday following the corn shucking, as
      Melissa was returning from meeting through the woods alone, the very one
      who was uppermost in her troubled mind joined her. He emerged from the
      thick-growing bushes which skirted her path, with a very pale face and
      unhappy mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest couldn't wait another minute, Melissa,&rdquo; he said, standing
      awkwardly before her, &ldquo;not ef I had to be shot fur it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paw's mighty stubborn an' contrary when he takes a notion,&rdquo; she said,
      with hanging head and an embarrassed kick of her foot at a tuft of grass.
      &ldquo;I think he mought let me alone. You ain't the only one he hates. Thar's
      ol' man Lawson; law, he hates him wuss'n canker! I heerd 'im say tother
      day ef somebody 'u'd jest beat Lawson shootin' next match he'd be his
      friend till death. He ain't never got over his lawsuit with Lawson over
      the sheep our dog killed. Paw fit it in court through three terms, an'
      then had to give in an' settle the claim an' all the costs besides. It
      mighty nigh broke im. Fur the last five years Lawson has driv home the
      prize beef from the fall match, an' every time paw jest fairly shakes with
      madness over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dick left Melissa at the bars in sight of her house and turned toward
      his home a warm idea was tingling in his brain, and by the time he had
      reached his father's cottage he was fairly afire with it. The shooting
      match was to take place in a month&mdash;what was to prevent him from
      taking part in it? He had an excellent rifle, and had done some good
      shooting at squirrels. Perhaps if he would practice a good deal he might
      win. Lawson was deemed the best marksman in all the Cohutta valleys, and
      frequently it had been hard to get anyone to enter a match against him.
      Dick at last decided to enter the forthcoming match at all events. He went
      into his cottage and took down his rifle from its deer-horn rack over the
      door. While he was eyeing the long, rusty barrel critically his old mother
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fixin' fur a hunt, Dick? Thar's a power o' pa'tridges in the sage field
      down the hollar. A rifle ain't as good fur that sort o' game as a shotgun;
      suppose you step over an' ax Hanson to loan you his'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest 'lowed I'd shine this un up a bit bein' as it's Sunday an' I hate
      to be idle,&rdquo; he answered, evasively, as he seated himself at the wide
      fireplace with a pan of grease and a piece of cloth and rubbed his gun
      barrel until it fairly shone in the firelight. The next morning he threw
      it over his shoulder and, taking an axe in his hand, he started toward the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't know but I mought find a bee tree somers,&rdquo; he said sheepishly, as
      he saw his mother looking wonderingly at the axe. &ldquo;Not likely, but I
      mought, thar's no tellin', though the darn little varmints do keep
      powerful close hid this time o' year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went over the hills and through the tangled woods until he came to a
      secluded old field. He singled out a walnut tree near its centre, and
      going to it he cut a square white spot in the bark with his axe. It is
      needless to detail all that took place there that day, or on other days
      following it. For the first week the earnest fellow would return from this
      spot each afternoon with a very despondent look upon him. As time passed,
      however, and his visits to the riddled tree grew more frequent his face
      began to grow brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once his mother came suddenly upon him as he stood in the cottage before
      the open door with his rifle placed in position for firing. He lowered his
      gun with a deep blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'us jest a tryin' to see how long I could keep the sight on that shiny
      spot out thar in the field without flinchin'. Blame me, ef you hadn't come
      in I believe I could a helt her thar tell it thundered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said the old woman, with a deep breath, &ldquo;what on earth has got in
      you here lately? Are you gwine plump stark crazy 'bout that old gun? You
      never tuk on that way before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've jest found out I'm purty good on a shot, that's all,&rdquo; he replied,
      evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as fur as that's concerned, in old times our stock was
      reckoned to be the best marksmen in our section. You ort to be; yore
      narrer 'twixt the eyes, an' that's a shore sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick caught a glimpse of Melissa now and then, and managed to exchange a
      few words with her occasionally, the nature of which we will not disclose.
      It may be said, however, that she was always in good spirits, which
      puzzled her father considerably, for he was at a loss to see why she
      should be so when Dick had not visited her since the night of the corn
      shucking. Moreover, she continually roused her father's anger by speaking
      frequently of the great honor that belonged to Farmer Lawson for so often
      Winning the prizes in the shooting matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dang it, Melissa, dry up!&rdquo; he exclaimed, boiling with anger, &ldquo;you know I
      hate that daddrated man. I'd fling my hat as high as the moon ef some o'
      these young bucks 'u'd beat him this fall; he's as full o' brag as a lazy
      calf is with fleas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use a hopin' fur anything o' that sort, paw; Lawson's too old a han'.
      He ain't got his equal at shootin' ur lawin.' The whole country couldn't
      rake up a better one.&rdquo; After speaking in this manner she would stifle a
      giggle by holding her hand over her mouth until she was livid in the face,
      and escape from her mystified parent, leaving him to vent his spleen on
      the empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of the annual shooting match drew near. It was not known who were
      to be the participants aside from Lawson, for the others usually waited
      till the time arrived to announce their intentions. No better day could
      have been chosen. The sky was blue and sprinkled with frothy clouds, and
      the weather was not unpleasantly cold. Women and men, boys, girls and
      children from all directions were assembled to witness the sport and were
      seated in chairs and wagons all over the wide, open space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melissa was there in a cluster of girls, and her father was near by in a
      group of men, all of whom&mdash;like himself&mdash;disliked the
      blustering, boasting Lawson and fondly hoped that someone would beat him
      on this occasion. Lawson stood by himself, with a confident smile on his
      face. His rifle butt rested on the grass and his hands were folded across
      each other on the end of his gun barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilks,&rdquo; said he to the clerk of the county court, who had been chosen as
      referee for the occasion, &ldquo;git up yore list o' fellers that are bold
      enough to shoot agin the champion. I reckon my nerves are 'bout as they
      wuz six yeer ago when I fust took my stan' here to larn this settlement
      how to shoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just before the list of aspirants was read aloud Dick managed to reach
      Melissa's side unobserved by her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you keep yore promise 'bout cut-tin' my patchin' fur me?&rdquo; he asked in
      a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers she drew from her pocket several little pieces of
      white cotton cloth about the size of a silver quarter of a dollar and gave
      them to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're jest right to a gnat's heel,&rdquo; he said, warmly. &ldquo;A ball packed in
      one o' them'll go straight ur I'm no judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; whispered she, looking him directly in the eyes, &ldquo;you ain't a bit
      flustered. I believe you'll win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a smile Dick turned away and joined the crowd round the referee's
      chair, and when his name was called a moment later among the names of four
      others he brought his rifle from a wagon and stood in view of the crowd.
      The first applause given that day was accorded him, for in addition to its
      being his first appearance in a shooting match he was universally popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully fur you, Dick; here's my han' wishing you luck!&rdquo; said a
      cheery-voiced farmer, shaking Dick's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the way with all these young strips,&rdquo; said Lawson in a loud,
      boastful tone. &ldquo;Gwine to conquer the whole round world. He'll grin on
      tother side o' his mouth when Bettie, the lead queen, barks and spits in
      the very centre o' that spot out yander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A feeble murmur of admiration greeted this vaunting remark, but it quickly
      subsided as the crowd noted that Dick Martin did not reply even by so much
      as to raise his eyes from the inspection of his gun. The referee called
      for order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Baker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be so kind as to drive round yore stall-fed heifer.
      Ladies an' gentlemen [as a man emerged from a group of wagons and drove a
      fine-looking young cow into the open space], here's a heifer in fine
      enough order to make any man's eyes sore to look. Fifteen round dollars
      has been paid in, by the five men who are to burn powder to-day, $3
      apiece, an' the man whose shootin' iron can fling lead the straightest on
      this occasion is entitled to the beef and the championship o' this valley
      till next fall. Now, Mr. Baker, lead out yore cow, an' the shooters will
      please form in a line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the aspirants stood in front of him the referee continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is five pieces o' straw, all different lengths. The man who gets the
      shortest one shoots fust, the next longest next, an' so on till you've all
      had yore crack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing the straws to the riflemen, and af ter they had drawn one each
      from his tightly closed hands, he ordered a man to set up the target&mdash;a
      planed plank, about one foot in width and six in length, with a round
      marked spot about three inches in diameter, near the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd willin'ly give my chance o' oats to have some o' them boys knock the
      stuffin' clean out'n Lawson; he's that stuck up he cayn't hardly walk,&rdquo;
       said Bagley, his anger intensified by observing the sneering smile on
      Lawson's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm mighty afeard,&rdquo; said the man to whom Bagley was speaking, &ldquo;that Dick
      Martin 'll lose his $3. I never heerd o' him bein' any han' with a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Bagley offered no reply. In his hatred for Lawson, and at such a
      time he had no thought to give to Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; rang out the voice of the referee. &ldquo;Bob Ransom gits the first
      pull at trigger to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell on the crowd as the tall, slender young man stepped forth and
      stood with his left foot on a line cut in the grass exactly 100 yards from
      the tree against which the yellow board with its single eye leaned in the
      sunbeams. Not a whisper escaped the motionless assembly as the young man
      slowly brought his weapon into position. &ldquo;Crack!&rdquo; sounded the rifle out of
      a balloon-shaped cloud of blue smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed centre, board, tree an' all!&rdquo; cried out Bagley, in a tone of deep
      regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seed yore lead plough up the dirt away out tother side; it's powerful
      hard to hold a steady han' when you are fust called on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next is Taylor Banks!&rdquo; announced the referee; and as a middle-aged man
      advanced and toed the mark, Lawson was heard to say, with a loud laugh;
      &ldquo;Fust one missed the tree; you folks on the left out thar 'u'd better set
      back fur-der; no tellin' who Banks 'll hit, fur he's a-tremblin' like so
      much jelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit about three inches due north o' the spot,&rdquo; called out the referee, as
      the smoke rose from the peering marksman. &ldquo;I'm afraid, Tayl', that
      somebody 'll come nigher than that when the pinch comes. Joe Burk is the
      next, an' I'll take occasion to say here that I know of no man in all this
      mountain country that is more prompt to pay his taxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crack!&rdquo; A universal bending of necks to get the target in better view and
      a rolling billow of voices in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A inch an' a half below the spot!&rdquo; proclaimed the referee. &ldquo;Why, friends,
      what ails you all? This ain't nigh such shootin' as we had last fall. Too
      many women present, I reckon. Ladies, if you'll cover up yore faces maybe
      the next two will do better. The straws say that Abraham Lawson has the
      next whack. Lawson, make yore bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The champion of the settlement stepped into view with a haughty strut,
      dragging his rifle butt on the ground and swinging his broad-brimmed hat
      carelessly in his hand. Turning to a negro behind him as he took his
      place, he said so that all could hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe, git yore rope ready an' stan' over thar nigh the beef. When you git
      'er home turn 'er in the pastur'. Ef this thing goes on year atter year
      I'll start a cattle ranch an' quit farmin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dang his hide!&rdquo; exclaimed Bagley to Melissa, who was very pale and quite
      speechless. &ldquo;Dang it, I'd lay this here right arm on any man's meat block
      an' give 'im leave to chop it off ef he'd jest git beat. He's that spiled
      flies is on 'im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lawson's hat was now on the grass at his feet and he had deliberately
      raised his brightly-polished weapon to his broad shoulder. The sun
      glittered on the long steel tube. The silence for an instant was so
      profound that the birds could be heard singing in the woods and the cawing
      of the crows in the corn fields near by sounded harsh to the ear. For an
      instant the sturdy champion stood as if molded in metal, his long hair
      falling over his gun stock, against which his tanned cheek was closely
      pressed. Not a sound passed the lips of the assembly, and when the rifle
      report came it sent a twinge to many a heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dang it!&rdquo; ejaculated Lawson, as he lowered his gun and peered through the
      rising smoke toward the target. &ldquo;I felt a unsteady quiver tech me jest as
      I pulled the trigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About half an inch from the very centre o' the mark. Yore ahead. Nobody
      is likely to come up to you, Lawson,&rdquo; said the referee. &ldquo;The' ain't but
      one more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't keer,&rdquo; replied Lawson. &ldquo;I know the cow's mine; but I did want to
      come up to my record. I walked too fast over here an' it made me
      unsteady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next an' last candidate for glory,&rdquo; said the referee, &ldquo;is Dick
      Martin. No cheerin', friends, it ain't been give to the others and you
      oughtn't to show partiality. Besides, it might excite him, an' he needs
      all the nerve he's got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bagley was still at Melissa's side. He had his eyes too intently fixed on
      the stalwart form of Dick Martin and the young man's pale, determined
      visage to note that his daughter had covered her pale face with her cold,
      trembling hands and bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jinks! he's the coolest cucumber that's lifted shootin' iron to-day,&rdquo;
       said Bagley under his breath. &ldquo;Ef he beats Lawson dagg me if I don't give
      him a dance in my barn an' invite every man, woman an' child in the whole
      valley.&rdquo; With his left foot on the mark and his right thrown back easily,
      as if he were taking a step forward, and his well-formed body bent
      slightly toward the target, Dick stood motionless, sighting along his gun
      barrel at the target. Then, to the surprise of all, he raised his gun
      until it pointed to the top of the tree against which the target leaned.
      Here a gentle sigh, born from the union of half surprise and half
      disappointment, swept over the crowd as low as the whisper of a breeze
      through a dry foliaged tree. The sigh died away and intense silence
      claimed the moment, for the gun's point was sweeping rapidly downward.
      Hardly a second did it pause in a line with the target's centre before the
      report came, putting every breast in sudden motion. The marker's eyes saw
      a clean splinter fly from the very centre of the round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beef is won by Dick Martin!&rdquo; loudly proclaimed the referee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoopee! Glory! Glory!&rdquo; The shout was from the lips of Bagley, and in an
      instant he had stridden across to Dick with outstretched hand. &ldquo;Glory,
      Glory! Dick!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;le'me have a hold o' yore fist. Tell judgment
      day I'm yore friend. I've said some sneakin' underhand things about you
      that's hurt yore feelin's an' I want to ax yore pardon. Dang it! I cayn't
      harbor no ill will agin a feller that's beat Abrum Lawson a-shootin'.
      Thank goodness you've fetched his kingdom to a end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When down-fallen Lawson had slunk away unnoticed from the enthusiastic
      crowd who were eager to congratulate Dick, Bagley came up to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, le'me have the honor o' drivin' the prize home fur you. Fur some
      reason ur other you didn't stay to supper with us corn-shuckin' night;
      Melissa's a waitin' fur you out thar in the bresh to ax you to come home
      with us to-night. By glory, Tobe,&rdquo; turning to Lawson's negro, &ldquo;this yer's
      the same identical beef Lawson ordered you to drive home an' put in his
      pastur', ain't it? Well, you jest tell 'im his friend Bagley tuk the job
      off'n yore han's.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MOERAN'S MOOSE&mdash;A HUNTING STORY, By Ed. W. Sandys.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE of the best
      fellows among the hardy lot who have ran the trails and paddled the lonely
      tributaries of the tipper Ottawa was Moeran. No bolder sportsman ever went
      into the woods, and few, or none of the guides or professional hunters
      could rival his skill with rifle or paddle. The tough old
      &ldquo;Leatherstockings&rdquo; fairly idolized him, for he got his game as they did,
      by straight shooting, perfect woodcraft, and honest hard work; and most of
      them, while they usually charged a heavy price for their services, would
      have gladly thrown in their lots with him for an outing of a month or
      more, and asked nothing save what he considered a fair division of the
      spoils. He was also a keen observer and a close student of the ways of
      bird and beast. The real pleasure of sport seemed to him to lie in the
      fact that it brought him very near to nature, and permitted him to pore at
      will over that marvelous open page which all might read if they chose, yet
      which few pause to study. His genial disposition and long experience made
      him ever a welcome and valuable companion afield or afloat, and the
      comrades he shot with season after season would have as soon gone into the
      woods without their rifles as without Moeran. Physically, he was an
      excellent type of the genuine sportsman. Straight and tall, and strongly
      made, his powerful arms could make a paddle spring, if need be, or his
      broad shoulders bear a canoe or pack over a portage that taxed even the
      rugged guides; and his long limbs could cover ground in a fashion that
      made the miles seem many and long to whoever tramped a day with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the kind of man that planned a trip for a party of four after
      the lordly moose. Moeran had, until that year, never seen a wild moose
      free in his own forest domain, and needless to say he was keenly anxious
      to pay his respects to the great king of the Canadian wilderness. He had
      been in the moose country many times while fishing or shooting in the
      provinces of New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba; he had seen the
      slots of the huge deer about pool and stream, on beaver meadow and brule;
      he had spent more than one September night &ldquo;calling,&rdquo; with a crafty Indian
      to simulate the plaintive appeals of a love-lorn cow; he had heard the
      great bulls answer from the distant hills&mdash;had heard even the low,
      grunting inquiry a bull moose generally makes ere emerging from the last
      few yards of shadowy cover, and revealing himself in all his mighty
      strength and pride in the moonlit open. More than once he had lain
      quivering with excitement and hardly daring to breathe, close-hidden in a
      little clump of scrub, about which stretched full forty yards of level
      grass on every side&mdash;lain so for an hour with every nerve strained to
      the ready, with ears striving to catch the faintest sound on the stillness
      of the night, and with eyes sweeping warily over the expanse of moonlit
      grass and striving vainly to pierce the black borders of forest, somewhere
      behind which his royal quarry was hidden. Upon such occasions he had lain
      and listened and watched until he fancied he could see the moose standing
      silently alert among the saplings, with ears shifting to and fro and with
      keen nose searching the air ceaselessly for trace of his mortal enemy. The
      occasional distant rattle of broad antlers against the trees as the big
      brute shook himself or plunged about in lusty strength had sounded on his
      ears, followed by the faint sounds of cautiously advancing footsteps
      seemingly bent straight toward the ambush. Then would follow a long
      agonizing pause, and then a snap of a twig or a faint rustling told that
      the crafty bull was stealing in a circle through the cover around the open
      space before venturing upon such dangerous ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0023" id="linkimage-0023"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0108.jpg" alt="0108 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0108.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At last a deathlike silence for many minutes, and then a faint, far snap
      of twigs and &ldquo;wish&rdquo; of straightening branches as the great bull stole away
      to his forested hills, having read in breeze or on ground a warning of the
      foe concealed in the harmless scrub. All these were disappointments, but
      not necessarily bitter ones. The long night-vigils were after all rarely
      spent entirely in vain, for each brought to him some new ideas, or let him
      a little further into the dark mysteries of the great wild world's nightly
      moods and methods. The skilled craft of his Indian &ldquo;caller;&rdquo; the strange
      voices of the night that came to his ears, telling of the movements of
      creatures but seldom seen or heard by day, were full of interest to a
      genuine woodsman. And then the fierce though subdued excitement of the
      weird watch for the huge beast that never came, and yet might come at any
      moment full into the silvery moonlight from out the black belt of silent
      wood&mdash;these were each fascinating to such a nature as his. But still
      he had never once seen his long-looked-for game, though several seasons
      had slipped away and the month of July, 18&mdash;&mdash;, had come and
      half passed by. Then Moeran got ready his fishing tackle and camping gear
      and vowed to find a good district for the party to shoot over the coming
      season, even if he had to remain in the woods an entire month. Right well
      he knew some of the likeliest points in New Brunswick, Quebec and
      Manitoba, the eastern portion of the latter province being the best moose
      country now available, but none of them met the requirements of the party,
      and so he decided to go into northern Ontario and prospect until he found
      what he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the region of the upper Ottawa River, and in the wild lands about the
      Mattawa River and about the lakes forming its headwaters, is a country
      beloved of moose. Thither went Moe-ran, satisfied that his quest would not
      be in vain. Early in the third week of July he and his Peterboro canoe and
      outfit reached the railway station of North Bay, on the shore of noble
      Lake Nipissing. While awaiting the arrival of the guide and team for the
      next stage of his journey, he put rod together and strolled out on the
      long pier which extends for a considerable distance into the lake.
      Reaching the farther end and looking down into the clear, green depths
      below, he saw watchful black bass skulking in the shadows, and lazy
      pickerel drifting hither and thither, in and out, among the great piles
      which supported the pier. To tempt a few of these to their doom was an
      easy task, and soon the lithe rod was arching over a game black gladiator
      and a master hand was meeting every desperate struggle of a fighting fish,
      or slowly raising a varlet pickerel to his inglorious death. In time a
      hail announced the arrival of the team, and after presenting his captives
      to the few loungers on the pier, he busied himself stowing canoe and
      outfit upon the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their objective point was on the shore of Trout Lake, a lovely sheet of
      water distant from Nipissing about four miles. The road was in many places
      extremely bad and the team made slow progress, but there was plenty of
      time to spare and about noon they reached the lake. The guide, as guides
      are given to do, lied cheerfully and insistently every yard of the way,
      about the beauty of the lake, the countless deer and grouse upon its
      shores, the gigantic fish within its ice-cold depths, the game he, and
      parties he had guided, had killed, and the fish they had caught. He did
      well with these minor subjects, but when he touched upon moose and bear he
      rose to the sublime, and lied with a wild abandon which made Moeran
      seriously consider the advantage of upsetting the canoe later on and
      quietly drowning him. But he was not so far astray in his description of
      the lake. It formed a superb picture, stretching its narrow length for a
      dozen miles between huge, rolling, magnificently wooded hills, while here
      and there lovely islands spangled its silver breast. After a hurried lunch
      they launched the good canoe, the guide insisting upon taking his rifle,
      as, according to his story, they were almost certain to see one or more
      bear. The guide proved that he could paddle almost as well as he could
      lie, and the two of them drove the light craft along like a scared thing,
      the paddles rising and falling, flashing and disappearing, with that
      beautiful, smooth, regular sweep that only experts can give. For mile
      after mile they sped along, until at last they neared the farther end of
      the lake, where the huge hills dwindled to mere scattered mounds, between
      which spread broad beaver meadows, the nearest of them having a pond
      covering many acres near its center. All about this pond was a dense
      growth of tall water-grasses, and in many places these grasses extended
      far into the water which was almost covered, save a few open leads, with
      the round, crowding leaves of the water-lily. A channel, broad and deep
      enough to float the canoe, connected this pond with the lake, and, as the
      locality was an ideal summer haunt for moose, Moeran decided to
      investigate it thoroughly and read such &ldquo;sign&rdquo; as might be found. Landing
      noiselessly, he and the guide changed places, Moeran kneeling, forward,
      with the rifle on the bottom of the canoe in front of him, where he alone
      could reach it. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you know the route and how to
      paddle; work her up as if a sound would cost your life. I'll do the
      watching.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Slowly, silently, foot by foot, and sometimes inch by inch, the canoe
      stole up the currentless channel, the guide never raising his paddle, but
      pushing with it cautiously against the soft bottom and lily-roots. It was
      a good piece of canoe work, worthy even of Moeran's noted skill, and he
      thoroughly appreciated it. By motions of his hand he indicated when to
      halt and advance, while his eyes scanned sharply every yard of marsh
      revealed by the windings of the channel. Not the slightest sound marked
      their progress until they had almost entered the open water in the center
      of the pond, and were creeping past the last fringe of tall grass.
      Suddenly Moeran's hand signaled a halt, and the canoe lost its slow,
      forward motion. He looked and looked, staring fixedly at a point some
      twenty yards distant, where the growth of grass was thin and short and the
      lily-pads denser than usual, and as he gazed with a strange concentration,
      a wild light flashed in his eyes until they fairly blazed with exultant
      triumph. Straight before him among the faded greens and bewildering browns
      of the lily-pads was a motionless, elongated brown object very like the
      curved back of a beaver, and a foot or more from it, in the shadow of a
      clump of grass, something shone with a peculiar liquid gleam. It was an
      eye&mdash;a great, round, wild eye&mdash;staring full into his own&mdash;the
      eye of a moose&mdash;and the curving object like the back of a beaver was
      naught else than the enormous nose, or muffle, of a full-grown bull.
      Something like a sigh came from it, and then it slowly rose higher and
      higher until the head and neck were exposed. The big ears pointed stiffly
      forward, and the nose twitched and trembled for an instant as it caught
      the dreaded taint; then with a mighty floundering and splashing the great
      brute struggled to his feet. It was a grewsome spectacle to see this
      uncouth creature uprise from a place where it seemed a muskrat could
      hardly have hidden. For a few seconds he stood still.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot! Shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moeran simply picked up the rifle and brought it level.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Load! 'Tain't loaded&mdash;the lever&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no response, merely covered, first the point of the shoulder and
      then the ear, and then, as the bull plunged for the shore, he covered the
      shoulder twice more, then lowered the rifle, while a horribly excited
      guide cursed and raved and implored by turns in vain. And just how great
      was the temptation was never known, but it certainly would have proved
      irresistible to most men who call themselves sportsmen. In speaking about
      it afterward Moeran said: &ldquo;It would have been a crime to have murdered the
      beast under such conditions, and out of season. I covered him fair four
      times, and could have dropped him dead where he stood&mdash;but we'll
      attend to them later on.&rdquo; For there were, in all, four moose in the pond,
      and, shortly after the big bull commenced his noisy retreat, a tremendous
      splashing and plunging from the other side of the pond attracted their
      attention. They turned just in time to see a grand old cow and two younger
      moose struggle through the last few yards of mud and water, and then crash
      their way into the cover at the rapid, pounding trot peculiar to the
      species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moeran's mission had been accomplished much easier than was expected, and
      he certainly had discovered a most promising locality for the trip with
      his friends. After a day spent fishing, he departed homeward, leaving his
      canoe and camp outfit in charge of the guide, whom he also bound by most
      solemn pledge neither to betray the secret of the beaver meadow, nor to
      molest the moose himself, before Moeran and his friends returned in time
      for the first lawful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day of the close season saw the party and the guide snugly
      encamped at a point half-way down the lake. His three friends had
      unanimously agreed that Moeran should have the honor of visiting the
      beaver meadow first, and alone if he desired. He was the surest shot and
      by far the best hand at this sort of business, and he had discovered the
      moose, while all hands knew how keen he was to secure a head to his own
      rifle. So at earliest dawn Moeran put lunch and rifle into his shapely
      Peterboro and sped noiselessly away through the ghostly vapors curtaining
      the sleeping lake, and they saw him no more for many hours. The guide had
      questioned the others about their comrade's shooting (of his ability at
      the paddle he had somewhat sorrowful remembrance), and then, strange to
      say, had advised Moeran to go alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much more glory for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I'll look after these other
      gentlemen and give them a day's fishing.&rdquo; But his manner was shifty, and
      Moeran mistrusted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time he reached the little channel leading to the beaver meadow,
      and, as the sun lifted clear of the distant hills, he began working his
      way to the pond. He hardly expected to find the moose there then, but he
      had made up his mind to steal into the high grass and hide and watch all
      day, if necessary, and, at all events, study the thing out thoroughly. As
      the sun rose higher a brisk breeze sprang up, but as it came from the
      woods toward his station he did not mind, although it would have been
      fatal to his chance, probably, had it come from any other point of the
      compass. Presently his nose detected a strong, sickening odor of carrion,
      which, in time, as the breeze gained force, became almost overpowering,
      and he started to investigate. Paddling straight up-wind he came at last
      to a small pool, and the trouble was explained. The half-decomposed body
      of a full-grown cow moose lay in the pool and Moeran muttered savagely his
      opinion of all such butchery when he saw that not even the feet had been
      taken for trophies. Then he poled his canoe to the edge of the meadow and
      scouted carefully entirely round the open, seeking for any possible sign
      of the remainder of the quartet. To his utter disgust he found the remains
      of another moose, one of the younger animals, lying just within the
      borders of the cover, and, as in the other case, the butcher had not
      troubled himself to take away any portion of his victim. Moeran
      understood, of course, that the guide had played him false, and if that
      worthy had been present he might have seriously regretted his wrong-doing,
      for he it was who had guided a learned and honorable (?) American judge to
      the sanctuary of the moose a month previously, and, for a consideration of
      twenty-five dollars, enabled his patron to gratify his taste for the
      shambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moeran's careful search discovered no fresh sign, and he made up his mind
      that the two survivors, the old bull and the yearling, had fled the scene
      and had probably sought another expanse of beaver meadow and ponds the
      guide had mentioned as being about ten miles from Trout Lake. Moeran knew
      that some sort of a trail led thither, and he resolved to find it and
      follow it to the end and endeavor to locate the moose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the ensuing long, hard day's work it will be unnecessary to speak in
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock that night his three friends sat near their roaring
      camp-fire on the lake shore, wondering at his protracted absence. The
      guide had turned in an hour previous, but the three were anxious, so they
      sat and smoked, and discussed the question, piling great drift-logs on
      their fire till it roared and cracked in fierce exultation and leaped high
      in air to guide the wanderer home. Its long, crimson reflection stretched
      like a pathway of flame far over the black waters of the lake, and the
      three sat and waited, now glancing along this glowing path, anon
      conversing in subdued tones. The lake was as still and dark as a lake of
      pitch, and some way the three felt ill at ease, as though some evil
      impended. At last the veteran of the trio broke a longer silence than
      usual:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I don't like this. It's ten o'clock and he should have been back
      long ago. I hope to Heaven&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A touch on his arm from the man at his right caused him to glance quickly
      lakeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty feet from them, drifting noiselessly into the firelight, was the
      Peterboro, with Moeran kneeling as usual and sending the light craft
      forward in some mysterious manner which required no perceptible movement
      of the arms nor lifting of the paddle. It was a fine exhibition of his
      skill to thus approach unheard three anxious, listening men on such a
      night, for he had heard their voices good two miles away. His appearance
      was so sudden, so ghostlike, that for a few seconds the party stared in
      mute surprise at the forms of man and craft standing out in sharp relief
      against the blackness of the night; then a whoop of delight welcomed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came ashore, swiftly picked up the canoe and turned it bottom upward on
      the sand for the night, carried his rifle into camp, then approached the
      fire and looked sharply round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guide's asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; him!&rdquo; Then he flung himself down
      on the sand. Something in his tone and manner warned his friends not to
      talk, and they eyed him curiously. His face was white as death and drawn
      with an expression of utter exhaustion, and marked with grimy lines,
      showing where rivulets of sweat had trickled downward. As they looked, his
      eyes closed; he was going to sleep as he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly the veteran busied himself getting food ready, and presently
      roused the slumberer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, old chap, have a nip and eat a bite. Why, you're dead beat. Where
      on earth have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strangely hollow voice answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the back lakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His listeners whistled a combined long-drawn &ldquo;whew&rdquo; of amazement, for
      right well they knew the leagues of toilsome travel this statement
      implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded the old bull badly, and trailed him from the lakes to within five
      miles of here. That cur sleeping yonder sold us; but you hear me!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed with sudden fierce energy, &ldquo;<i>I'll get that moose if I have to
      stay in the woods forever!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three looked at him in admiring silence, for they guessed that, in
      spite of his terrible day's work, he intended starting again at daylight.
      In a few moments he finished his meal and staggered to the tent, and fell
      asleep as soon as he touched his blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the party turned out next morning the canoe was gone, though the sun
      was not yet clear, of the hills. After breakfast they started in quest of
      grouse, working through the woods in the direction of the beaver meadows,
      and finding plenty of birds. About ten o'clock they heard the distant
      report of a rifle, followed in a few minutes by a second, and the veteran
      exclaimed, &ldquo;That's him, for an even hundred, and he's got his moose, or
      something strange has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At noon they returned to camp laden with grouse. No sign of the canoe as
      yet, so they had dinner, and lounged about and fished during the
      afternoon, casting many expectant glances down the lake for the laggard
      canoe. Night fell, with still no sound or sign of the wanderer, and again
      the camp-fire roared and flamed and sent its glowing reflection streaming
      far over the black waste of water. And again the three sat waiting. At ten
      o'clock the veteran rose and said, &ldquo;Keep a sharp lookout, boys, and don't
      let him fool you again, and I'll get up a royal feed. He'll have
      moose-meat in the canoe this time, for he said <i>he'd get that moose if
      he had to stay in the woods forever</i>. He'll be dead beat, sure, for
      he's probably dragged the head out with him.&rdquo; So they waited, piling the
      fire high, and staring out over the lake for the first glimpse of the
      canoe. Eleven o'clock and midnight came and went, and still no sign. Then
      they piled the fire high for the last time and sought the tent. At the
      door the veteran halted, and laying a hand on the shoulder of his chum,
      drew him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whatever's the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man's face wore a piteous expression, and his voice trembled as he
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Don't let <i>him</i> hear you&mdash;but there's something wrong.
      Something horrible has happened&mdash;I feel it in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, man! You're sleepy and nervous. He's all right. Why, he's just
      cut himself a moose steak, and had a feed and laid down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was never completed. A sound that caused both men to start
      convulsively tore through the black stillness of the night. A horrible,
      gurgling, demoniacal laugh came over the lake, and died away in fading
      echoes among the hills. &ldquo;Woll-oll-all-ollow-wall-all-ollow!&rdquo; as though
      some hideous fiend was laughing with his lips touching the water. They
      knew what it was, for the loon's weird cry was perfectly familiar to them,
      and they laughed too, but there was no mirth in their voices. Then one
      sought the tent, but the veteran paced up and down upon the cold beach,
      halting sometimes to replenish the fire or to stare out over the water,
      until a pale light spread through the eastern sky. Then he too turned in
      for a couple of hours of troubled, unrefreshing slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright sunshine of an Indian summer's day brought a reaction and their
      spirits rose wonderfully; but still the canoe tarried, and as the hours
      wore away, the veteran grew moody again and the midday meal was a
      melancholy affair. Early in the afternoon he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I tell you what it is: I can stand this no longer&mdash;something's
      wrong, and we're going to paddle those two skiffs down to the beaver
      meadow and find out what we can do, and we're going to start right now.
      God forgive us if we have been idling here while we should have been
      yonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two in a boat they went, and the paddles never halted until the channel to
      the beaver meadow was gained. Dividing forces, they circled in opposite
      directions round the open, but only the taint of the long-dead moose
      marked the spot. Then they fired three rifles in rapid succession and
      listened anxiously, but only the rolling, bursting echoes of the woods
      answered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guide, where would he probably have gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, he told you he'd run the old bull this way from the back lakes&mdash;thar's
      another leetle mash a mile north of us; it's an awful mud-hole, and the
      bull might possibly hev lit out fur thar. Enyhow, we'd best hunt the
      closest spots first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The picture of that marsh will haunt the memories of those three men until
      their deaths. A few acres of muskeg, with broad reaches of sullen, black,
      slimy water, its borders bottomless mud, covered with a loathsome green
      scum, and a few pale-green, sickly-looking larches dotting the open&mdash;the
      whole forming a repulsive blemish, like an ulcer, on the face of the
      earth. All round rose a silent wall of noble evergreens, rising in massive
      tiers upon the hills, with here and there a flame of gorgeous color where
      the frost had touched perishable foliage. Overhead a hazy dome of dreamy
      blue, with the sun smiling down through the gauzy curtains of the Indian
      summer. Swinging in easy circles, high in air, were two ravens,
      challenging each other in hollow tones, their orbits crossing and
      recrossing as they narrowed in slow-descending spirals. &ldquo;Look, look at
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      One bird had stooped like a falling plummet, and now hung about fifty
      yards above the farther bounds of the muskeg, beating the air with heavy,
      sable pinions and croaking loudly to his mate above. Closing her wings,
      she stooped with a whizzing rush to his level, and there the two hung
      flapping side by side, their broad wings sometimes striking sharply
      against each other, their hoarse, guttural notes sounding at intervals. A
      nameless horror seized the men as they looked. Their hunter's instinct
      told them that death lay below those flapping birds, and with one impulse
      they hurried round on the firmer ground to the ill-omened spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran, white-faced but active as a lad, tore his way through the
      bordering cover first, halted and stared for an instant, then dropped his
      rifle in the mud, threw up his hands and exclaimed in an agonized voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One by one they crashed through the brush and joined him, and stood
      staring. No need for questions. Ten square yards of deep-trodden, reeking
      mud and crushed grass, a trampled cap, and here and there a rag of brown
      duck; a silver-mounted flask shining in a little pool of bloody water; a
      stockless rifle-barrel, bent and soiled, sticking upright; beyond all a
      huge, hairy body, and below it a suggestion of another body and a
      blood-stained face, that even through its terrible disfigurement seemed to
      scowl with grim determination. Throwing off their coats, they dragged the
      dead moose aside and strove to raise Moeran's body, but in vain. Something
      held it; the right leg was broken and they found the foot fast fixed in a
      forked root the treacherous slime had concealed. In the right hand was
      firmly clutched the haft of his hunting knife, and in the moose's throat
      was the broken blade. The veteran almost smiled through his tears as they
      worked to loosen the prisoned foot, and muttered, &ldquo;Caught like a bear in a
      trap; he'd have held his own with a fair chance.&rdquo; Carrying the poor,
      stamped, crushed body to the shade, they laid it upon the moss and
      returned to read the story of the fearful battle. To their hunter's eyes
      it read as plainly as printed page. The great bull, sore from his previous
      wound, had sought the swamp. Moeran had trailed him to the edge and
      knocked him down the first shot, and after reloading had run forward to
      bleed his prize. Just as he got within reach the bull had struggled up and
      charged, and Moeran had shot him through the second time. Then he had
      apparently dodged about in the sticky mud and struck the bull terrific
      blows with the clubbed rifle, breaking the stock and bending the barrel,
      and getting struck himself repeatedly by the terrible forefeet of the
      enraged brute. To and fro, with ragged clothes and torn flesh, he had
      dodged, the deadly muskeg behind and on either side, the furious bull
      holding the only path to the saving woods. At last he had entrapped his
      foot in the forked root, and the bull had rushed in and beaten him down,
      and as he fell he struck with his knife ere the tremendous weight crushed
      out his life. The veteran picked up the rifle-barrel, swept it through a
      pool and examined the action, and found a shell jammed fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      In despairing voice he said, &ldquo;Oh, boys, boys, if that shell had but come
      into place our friend had won the day, but he died like the noble fellow
      he was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With rifles and coats they made a stretcher and carried him sadly out to
      the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He would get that moose, or stay in the woods forever!</i>&rdquo;

      I hate making cartridges. Perhaps I am a novice, and have not a good kit,
      and am lazy, and clumsy, and impatient, and&mdash;&mdash; But go on and
      account for it yourself at greater length, if you will, my friends; only
      accept my solemn statement that I detest the operation, which, I am
      convinced, ought to be confined to able-bodied colored men with
      perseverance and pachydermatous knuckles.

      An ordinary man is always in fluster and fever before he completes loading
      up for a day's gunning. His patent plugger becomes inexplicably and
      painfully fractious; his percussions are misfits; his No. 10 wads prove to
      be No. 12s; his shot sack is sure to spill; his canister is certain to
      sustain a dump into the water pail, and, when he begins to reflect on all
      the unmentionable <i>lapsi linguæ</i> of which his numerous vexations are
      the immediately exciting, though possibly not the responsible, cause, he
      is apt to conclude that, say what you may in favor of the breechloader,
      there are a certain few points which commend the old-time muzzle-loader,
      especially when it comes around to charging a shell.

      At all events, that is the kind of man I now am; and if the reader is not
      prepared to absolutely indorse me all through these crotchety cogitations,
      may I not hope he will at least bear with me patiently and give me time to
      outgrow it, if possible? But, as I was saying, I have charged up and am
      ready to sally forth and join the hunting party of the Blankville Gun
      Club, who had organized a match for Christmas Eve, a bright, nippy day of
      &ldquo;an open winter&rdquo;&mdash;as experienced in Northeastern Ontario, at any
      rate. I don my game bag, strap on my belt, pick up my newly-bought
      hammerless and prepare to leave the house. My cocker Charlie, long since
      cognizant of what my preparations meant, is at heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wild light in his eyes, but, self-contained animal that he is,
      not a yelp, whine or even tail wag is manifested to detract from his
      native dignity and self possession. &ldquo;Native&rdquo; dignity? Aye! My dog boasts
      it naturally; and yet, at the same time, I fancy the switch and I have had
      something to do in developing it and teaching the pup its apparently
      unconscious display.

      The silky-coated canine knows as well as I do that he is in for an

      jump out of his hide. Yet the only answer he dare give to the inquiry is
      an appealing glance from his hazel orbs up at his master's immovable face.
      Yes, my dog Charlie is sober and sensible, and I am proud of these
      characteristics and their usefulness to me before the gun.

      &ldquo;Good-bye, little woman!&rdquo; I sing out cheerily to my wife as I pass down
      the hall. She comes to the door to see me off. Sometimes, perhaps, a man
      will find his adieu on an occasion of this kind responded to uncordially,
      not to say frigidly, or perhaps not at all. But he must not grieve deeply
      over it or let it act as an excitative of his mean moroseness or angry
      passion. Think the thing all over. You are to be far away from home. Why
      should not the thought of the vacant chair&mdash;next to that of the
      demonstrative and exacting baby at meal time&mdash;rise up and sadden your
      wife? Can you wonder at her distant bearing as she foresees how she will
      sigh &ldquo;for the touch of a vanished hand&rdquo;&mdash;on the coal scuttle and
      water pail? Of course, she will &ldquo;miss your welcome footsteps&rdquo;&mdash;carrying
      in kindlings, and the &ldquo;dear, familiar voice&rdquo;&mdash;calling up the
      chickens. And so you cannot in reason expect her invariably to answer your
      kindly <i>adios</i> in a gladsome, gleesome, wholly satisfied sort of way.
      But never you go away without the goodbye on your part&mdash;the honest,
      manly, loving-toned good-bye that will ring in her ears in your absence
      and cause her to fancy that perhaps you are not such a selfish old bear
      after all.

      small selfishness on their part! Come, gentlemen, let us once and for all
      rightly appreciate the situation and resolve to do better in the future!
      But let us return to our sheep. My hand is on the door knob, when,
      pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, is heard the tread of tiny feet. It is Ted, my
      little two year old, coming to say good-bye to papa. I take him up and
      sing gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Bye, baby bunting,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Papa goes a-hunting,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To get a little rabbit skin
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To wrap the baby bunting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How the little man crows and gurgles in glee! Then he grows demonstrative
      and he wants to take off my cap. He makes a grab at my game bag. As I put
      him down gently he tries to disarm me and possess himself of the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, what an awful bother about the house of the sportsman is the
      toddling tot of a baby! He is always getting hold of your gun swab for a
      fish pole or to bang the dog about. Putting holes in your fish basket with
      a big nail or a table knife is a supreme source of delight to him. He has
      a mania for planting carpet tacks in your hunting boots. Making
      smokestacks for mud houses with your brass shells is a passion with him.
      If he can get hold of your ammunition to make paste of the powder, and
      pulp of the wads, and a hopeless mixture of the shot, he is simply in his
      element. Give him possession of your lines and access to your fly book and
      he enjoys an hour of what is, to him, immense fun, but to you pronounced
      and positive destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet&mdash;you wouldn't be without, that self-same baby if to keep him
      cost you every shooting iron and foot of tackle you ever owned or hoped to
      own, and at the same time destroyed the prospect of you ever again having
      a &ldquo;day out&rdquo; on this rare old earth of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite safe to say that the article for which you would exchange that
      merry, mischievous toddler of yours, who clasps your brown neck with
      little white, soft arms and presses a sweet baby kiss to your bristled
      lips, as he sees you off on an outing, has not now an existence&mdash;and
      you do not seem to exactly remember when it had. And you do not care
      whether he destroys your possessions; they can be replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed! Even you, most inveterate and selfish and calloused votary of
      the chase&mdash;you have a tender spot in your hard old heart for the baby
      boy. He may not be all that is orderly, obedient, non-combatable,
      non-destructive, but still we all love him! Not one of us, at all events,
      but will frankly admit that we respect him&mdash;for his father's sake.
      Need anything more be said?
    </p>
    <p>
      And do not we also respect those who depict him in tenderness and
      affection?

      Don't we think all the more of Scanlon the actor for his inimitable
      &ldquo;Peek-a-boo?&rdquo; and of Charles Mackay for his &ldquo;Baby Mine?&rdquo; and of Bret Harte

      Has it ever occurred to you, my friend, that the baby is the same
      unchanged, unimproved article since the world began? Men are making
      smokeless powder, constructing pneumatic bicycle tires, inventing
      long-distance guns, training horses down to two minutes, getting sprinters
      to cover 100 yards close to nine seconds&mdash;revolutionizing everything,
      but leaving the baby the old-time brand!
    </p>
    <p>
      People seem satisfied with the original make, and far from any movement to
      abolish it as out of date. The sentiment would appear to be pretty
      universal:
    </p>
    <p>

    <p class="indent15">

      I have said &ldquo;bye-bye&rdquo; to my tiny Ted half a dozen times and at last am
      about to escape during his sudden flight to another part of the house,
      when I am arrested by the eager cry, half in inquiry, half in jubilation,
      &ldquo;Baby barlo! Papa, baby barlo! Dee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he stands, holding up my little patent flask as though he had made a
      wonderful discovery. To humor the child I took the little companion, said
      &ldquo;Ta-ta,&rdquo; and was in the act of slipping it back to my wife, when I decided
      to keep it. I am not partial to the cup that cheers and also inebriates,
      and yet I have an appreciation of the pocket pistol that warms, sustains
      and heartens in a long tramp on a zero afternoon with only a dog for
      companionship and the chances of bagging anything much reduced to a
      minimum. I stepped to the sideboard and filled the &ldquo;barlo&rdquo; <i>quantum suff</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Scrib! You're early on deck&rdquo; was the grunting of the Doc. &ldquo;None of
      the others are here yet. But I guess we'll not have long to wait. There is
      surely no laggard or lunkhead in our jolly sextette. On such an occasion
      as a Christmas Eve hunt, with an oyster supper at stake, the resources of
      our whole happy hunting grounds on trial, and the pluck and prowess of six
      rival sports in question there should certainly be no such word as
      'funk!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as the Doc spoke Tinker dropped in. Hardly was he seated when Shy
      puffed his way into the little smoking room. We waited five minutes for
      the Judge, and had become impatient before Budge put in an appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an assortment of unique nomenclature! Gun-club designations they
      were, of course. In polite society &ldquo;Scrib&rdquo; was the village editor;
      &ldquo;Tinker&rdquo; was our general store keeper; &ldquo;The Judge&rdquo; was young Lawyer B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;;
      &ldquo;Budge&rdquo; was mine host of the Queen's Arms, and the &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; was just the
      doctor&mdash;our large-hearted, clever, hard-working local M. D., the life
      and soul of the sport-loving community, as he was also the idol of the
      village and district for his skill, his unselfishness and his unvarying <i>bonhomie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Budge!&rdquo; exclaims the Doc. &ldquo;As president of this club I fine you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rise to a point of order!&rdquo; breaks in the Judge. &ldquo;This meeting is not
      yet duly open, and, at all events, this is a special one, and business of
      the regular order must be excluded. Referring to the constitution&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to thunder with the constitution! Let us get off on our hunt!&rdquo; And
      Tinker looks annihilation at the order pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, fellows,&rdquo; laughs the Doc, &ldquo;I shall rule partially in favor of
      both. I shall rule that Budge do tell us his latest joke as a penalty.
      Come now, prisoner, out with it and save your fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, boys,&rdquo; begins Budge, deprecatingly, &ldquo;don't insist. I'm sorry I was
      late, but the fact is I was giving elaborate orders for the supper, which
      I know it will be just my luck to get stuck for. One of my special orders
      was to secure a magnificent roast and have it cooked in Ben Jonson style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Jonson style? How is that?&rdquo; queries the Doc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O, rare Ben Jonson!' There, Mr. President,&rdquo; he adds, when the laugh
      ceases, &ldquo;I believe that debt is squared.&rdquo; We have made out our list and
      fixed points, ranging from chipmunk, 1, to bear, 1,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave out quail, I notice. Now that is an omission which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Judge is cut short on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out in the wild and woolly West, from whence you have but recently
      emigrated to civilization and refinement,&rdquo; remarks the Doc, &ldquo;quail are
      about as plentiful as hedge sparrows are here. But a quail has not been
      seen in this section for ten years, I'll venture to say. No, Judge, we
      needn't point on quail this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; I observe in an encouraging tone, &ldquo;who knows but we may each
      and all happen on a covey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is extravagant. But if any man should be lucky enough to bag a
      brace, that I may enjoy one more good square meal of quail on toast, I'll
      stand the supper.&rdquo; And the Judge looked straight at Budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that is what I would call extravagant&mdash;supper for a whole party
      in consideration of a dish of quail on toast. Suppose you yourself should
      bag the brace. But this reminds me of the man who ordered quail on toast
      in a Boston restaurant. He was brought in some toast. He waited a while.
      Presently he called the waiter and repeated the order. 'There you are,
      sir!' answered Thomas. 'That? That is toast, of course; but where's the
      quail?' The waiter pointed to a small speck in the centre of each slice,
      looking like a baked fly. 'Ah! so this dish is quail on toast, is it?'
      'Yes, sir!' 'Then you just remove it and bring me turkey on toast!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We draw lots for choice of directions, and fix 8 p. m. sharp for
      reassembling to compare scores. My choice fell on a due north course,
      along which, seven miles distant, lay cover where I had scarcely ever
      failed to find at least fair sport and to take game, such as it was. And I
      went it alone&mdash;barring my dog.

      Seven miles of hard footing it and I had only the brush of a couple of red
      squirrels, the wing of a chicken hawk, and the lean carcass of a small
      rabbit to show. I had sighted a fox far out of range, and had been taken
      unawares by a brace of birds which Charlie had nobly flushed and I had
      shockingly muffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog had followed the birds deeper into the wood, leaving me angry and
      uncertain what to do. Suddenly I heard his yelp of rage and disappointment
      give place to his business bark, and I knew my pup had a tree for me. It
      was a sound not to be mistaken. My dog never now plays spoof with me by
      tonguing a tree for hair. His business bark means partridge every time. I
      hurried on as the dog gave tongue more sharp and peremptory, taking a
      skirt to avoid a tangled piece of underbrush as I began-to approach the
      critical spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruins of an old shanty lay fifty yards to my left, and between them
      and me was a sort of <i>cache</i> or root cellar, the sides intact but the
      roof half gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden there broke on my ear a sound I had not heard for many a
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened, almost dumfounded. There it is again! And no mistaking it. It
      is the pipe of a quail!
    </p>
    <p>
      It came from a patch of meadow not many rods off, and it set every nerve
      in my body a-tingling. Charlie and his partridges were out of mind
      instanter. I had no manner of use for them at that supreme moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no stray bird!&rdquo; I mentally ejaculated. &ldquo;Perhaps it's a regular
      Kansas covey!&rdquo; Heavens, what luck! The boys&mdash;the Judge&mdash;quail on
      toast&mdash;the laugh&mdash;the amazement&mdash;the consternation&mdash;I
      conjured all these things up in my excited brain in less time than it
      takes to tell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started forward with every fibre a-tension. I was wild to get even a
      glimpse of the little strangers.

    <p>
      Suddenly&mdash;enough almost to puzzle me&mdash;the pipe was answered from
      the mouth of the old potato pit, and the next instant &ldquo;whir-r-r-r!&rdquo; rose
      the birds, and &ldquo;bang! bang!&rdquo; I gave them right and left at a range and
      with a calculation that left three only to join and tell the tale to the
      whistler in the meadow. Seven was the drop, and the birds were as plump
      and pretty as ever I had set eyes on. I fairly chuckled aloud in glee at
      the surprise I had in store for my club mates. I sat down, took a
      congratulatory nip, and actually toyed with the quail as a boy would with
      the first fruits of his initial day's outing with his own boughten gun!
    </p>
    <p>
      My faithful dog Charlie had during this time stuck to his birds. I could
      hear his angry bark growing angrier, and I could detect, as I fancied, a
      shade of impatience and disappointment therein. A crack at a partridge
      will be a change, I thought, and so I hurried in Charlie's direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sat on a rotten stump, with eyes fixed on the brushy top of a
      dead pine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked that top over, limb by limb, but not a sign of a feather could I
      detect. I made a circuit, and skinned every twig aloft in a vain endeavor
      to discover a roosting bird. I began to think the pup was daft, but I
      dismissed the reflection promptly as ungenerous and unfair to my trusty
      cocker. I make solemn affidavit that, though I could not note the
      suggestion of a partridge up that pine, my spaniel could see it as plain
      as a pike staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll climb the stump!&rdquo; said I. <i>Mirabile dictu!</i> There, on lower
      limbs, one above the other and hugging the bark so close that they seemed
      part of it, were my missed brace!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; and the topmost tumbles, nearly knocking his mate off as he falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; and down comes No. 2.
    </p>

      Charlie manifests a sense of relieved anxiety and satisfaction that of
      itself rewards me for the perplexing search.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a drowsiness had been creeping over me till its influence had become
      almost irresistible. I felt stupid and sleep-inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost without knowing what I did I pulled out my flask, poured &ldquo;just a
      nip&rdquo; a fair portion in the cup and drank it off. The twilight was coming
      on and casting its sombre shadows, <i>avant coureurs</i> of the black
      winter night that was soon to envelop the scene for a brief while, till
      fair Luna lit up the heavens and chased Darkness to its gloomy lair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an indistinct recollection of recalling lines I have read somewhere
      or other:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When Life's last sun is sinking slow and sad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      How cold and dark its lengthened shadows
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      fall.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      They lie extended on the straightened path
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Whose narrow close, the grave, must end it
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh, Life so grudging in your gifts, redeem

    <p class="indent20">
      By one great boon the losses of the Past!

      &ldquo;Full? I never knew him to more than taste liquor. No, no! You're
      mistaken. He has either been knocked senseless by some accident or
      mischance, or else he has fallen in a fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Doc who spoke. I suddenly grew seized of consciousness to the
      extent of recognizing my old friend's voice. But to indicate the fact
      physically was impossible. I lay in a sort of trance, with lips that would
      not open and hands that would not obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right, Doc! You ought to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time I caught the voice of the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is in a pitiable plight. We must get to him and move him or he may
      perhaps perish, if he's not gone now. Drat that dog! I don't want to shoot
      him; and yet he'll tear us if we try to lay hand on his master. But lay
      hand on him we must. Is it a go, Doc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the only alternative, Judge. I like canine fidelity; but hang me if
      this brute doesn't suit too well! We'll have to get him out of the way and
      succor the man. Give it to him, Judge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a superhuman effort, through some agency I never could account for, I
      managed to utter that one word in a sort of half expostulatory, half
      authoritative tone, or rather groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0035" id="linkimage-0035"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      It broke the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      My eyes opened. My arms regained power. Instinctively I reached out a hand
      and drew my canine guardian toward me, placing a cheek against his cold,
      moist nose. That was enough for Charlie. The faithful brute grew wild with
      joy. He barked, whined, jumped, capered, pirouetted after his own stump,
      and, in a word, did the most tremendous despite to all my careful training
      in the line of reserved and dignified demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose to a sitting posture and finally drew myself up on my feet, gazing
      around me in a bewildered, uncertain sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, boys, what's the matter?&rdquo; I managed to articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, and what's the matter yourself?&rdquo; replied the Doc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's precisely what we came out here to know,&rdquo; put in the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess&mdash;I think&mdash;yes, let me see!&mdash;I believe I&mdash;I&mdash;must
      have dropped off in a little doze, boys! Very kind of you to look me up.
      Only&mdash;say, you never surely meant to shoot my dog? I'd have haunted
      both of you to your respective dying days if you had, supposing I was a
      cold corpse instead of a man taking a little nap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking a little nap! Hear him! I should rather say you were. But, look
      here, Scrib, do your little naps always mean two or three hours of the
      soundest sleep a man ever slept who wasn't dead or drugged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead or drugged, Doc? Pshaw, you're away off. You can see for yourself I
      am not dead, and I can vow I wasn't drugged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you've been intoxicated, by George; and as president of the
      Blank-ville Gun Club I'll fine you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quail, as I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three; three brace and a half, Doc, and beauties,
      too! It does my heart good to handle the darlings. Doc, if Scrib has been
      full forty times to-day, he has more than atoned for the <i>lapsi</i> with
      this glorious bag. Whoop! Ya, ha! There'll be quail on toast for the whole
      party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time the Judge's jubilation had ceased I had about regained my
      normal condition and we were ready to make tracks homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock strikes the midnight hour as I re-enter my own home. My wife
      sits rocking the cradle, in which lies our darling Ted. She turns a
      weary-looking, tear-stained face to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its all right, dear,&rdquo; I gently remark, &ldquo;I'm quite safe, as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the slightest doubt of it, sir,&rdquo; she returns, icily. &ldquo;It's not
      of you I've been thinking, but of baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; I repeat inquiringly. &ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing the matter with him, but there is no telling what might
      have been. And all owing to your foolish indulgence of his fancy for
      bottles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean, dear?&rdquo; I venture. &ldquo;It means that you had not been gone
      an hour when I found Ted with that little two-ounce phial you left half
      filled with laudanum on the lower pantry shelf yesterday. He had evidently
      climbed a chair and reached it down. The cork was out and the bottle was
      empty. You can perhaps imagine my feelings. I didn't know whether he had
      taken the stuff or not, but was in an agony of anxiety on the point, you
      may be sure. The doctor was away hunting, you were away hunting, and here
      was I fairly consumed with apprehension lest my baby had poisoned
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a flash the whole mystery of my stupor sleep revealed itself to me.
      &ldquo;Baby barlo&rdquo;&mdash;flask&mdash;laudanum phial&mdash;whiskey&mdash;it was
      all as clear as day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;But it transpires he hadn't taken any of the laudanum, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank Heaven! But for all of you&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, please. All I want to say is that what Ted missed I got. Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>I</i> understand! Are <i>you</i> in your sane and sober senses,
      William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a shrewd suspicion that I am,&rdquo; I replied, with a slight laugh,
      &ldquo;and being so, I will repeat it: Baby didn't down the poison; but I guess
      I made up for that, because <i>I did!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I gained my point. It ended with&mdash;&mdash; but, no matter.
      The Judge stood the supper in consideration of quail on toast being
      incorporated in the menu, and we sat around the festive board in the
      Queen's Arms a week later, and talked over our Xmas Eve hunting match. No
      one was disposed to question the sentiment in a speech by the Doc, who
      declared: &ldquo;Fellows, our prowess as a gun club is growing, and I verily
      believe the old district is getting to be once more something like a
      half-decent hunting ground. Let us keep together, be as men and brothers
      always, and&mdash;I was nearly overlooking it&mdash;let us invariably wash
      out our pocket pistols before filling 'em up afresh.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      HERNE THE HUNTER, By William Perry Brown
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>erne the Hunter
      was tall, brown and grizzled. The extreme roundness of his shoulders
      indicated strength rather than infirmity, while the severing of his great
      neck at a blow would have made a feudal executioner famous in his craft.
      An imaginative man might have divined something comely beneath the complex
      conjunction of lines and ridges that made up his features, but it would
      have been more by suggestion, however, than by any actual resemblance to
      beauty traceable thereon. The imprint of strength, severity and endurance
      was intensified by an open contempt of appearance; only to a subtle
      second-sight was revealed aught nobler, sweeter and sadder, like faint
      stars twinkling behind filmy clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some town-bred Nimrod, with a misty Shakespearean memory, had added to his
      former patronymic of &ldquo;Old Herne&rdquo; that of Windsor's ghostly visitor. The
      mountaineers saw the fitness of the title, and &ldquo;Herne the Hunter&rdquo; became
      widely current.
    </p>
    <p>
      His place of abode was as ambiguous as his history, being somewhere beyond
      the &ldquo;Dismal,&rdquo; amid the upper caves and gorges of the Nantahalah. The
      Dismal was a weird, wild region of brake and laurel, walled in by lonely
      mountains, with a gruesome outlet between two great cliffs, that nearly
      met in mid-air hundreds of feet over a sepulchral Canyon, boulder-strewn,
      and thrashed by a sullen torrent, that led from a dolorous labyrinth,
      gloomy at midday, and at night resonant with fierce voices and sad
      sighings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far down in Whippoorwill Cove, the mountaineers told savage tales of
      adventure about the outskirts of the Dismal, yet, beyond trapping round
      the edges or driving for deer, it was to a great extent a <i>terra
      incognita</i> to all, unless Herne the Hunter was excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil air in the man, 'nd hopes him out'n places no hones' soul keers
      to pester hisse'f long of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was common opinion, though a few averred that &ldquo;Old Herne 'nd the
      devil wern't so master thick atter all.&rdquo; Said one: &ldquo;Why, the dinged old
      fool totes his Bible eroun' ez riglar ez he do his huntin'-shirt. Onct
      when the parson wuz holdin' the big August meetin' down ter Ebeneezer
      Meetin'-house, he stepped in. The meetin' was a gittin' ez cold ez hen's
      feet, 'nd everybody a lookin' at Herne the Hunter, when down he draps onto
      his knees, 'nd holdin' on by his rifle he 'gun ter pray like a house
      afire. Wal, he prayed 'nd he prayed, 'twel the people, arter thur skeer
      wuz over, 'gun ter pray 'nd shout too, 'nd fust they all knowed, the front
      bench wuz plum full of mou'ners. Wal, they hed a hog-killin' time fur a
      while, 'nd all sot on by Herne the Hunter, but when they quieted down 'nd
      begun ter luk fer him&mdash;by jing!&mdash;he wern't thar. Nobody hed seed
      him get erway, 'nd that set 'em ter thinkin', 'nd the yupshot wuz they hed
      the bes' meetin' old Ebeneezer hed seed in many a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once a belated hunter discovered, when the fog came down, that he was lost
      amid the upper gorges of the Nantahalahs. While searching for some cranny
      wherein to pass the night, he heard a voice seemingly in mid-air before
      him, far out over an abyss of seething vapor which he feared concealed a
      portion of the dreaded Dismal. Memories of Herne the Hunter crowded upon
      him, and he strove to retrace his steps, but fell into a trail that led
      him to a cave which seemed to bar his further way. The voice came nearer;
      his blood chilled as he distinguished imprecations, prayers and entreaties
      chaotically mingled, and all the while approaching him. He fled into the
      cave, and peering thence, beheld a shadowy form loom through the mist,
      gesticulating as it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whiff blew aside shreds of the fog, and he saw Herne the Hunter on the
      verge of a dizzy cliff, shaking his long rifle, his hair disheveled, his
      eyes dry and fiery, and his huge frame convulsed by the emotions that
      dominated him. The very fury and pathos of his passion were terrifying,
      and the watcher shrank back as old Herne, suddenly dropping his rifle,
      clutched at the empty air, then paused dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always thus!&rdquo; he said, in a tone of deep melancholy. &ldquo;Divine in form&mdash;transfigured&mdash;beautiful&mdash;oh,
      so beautiful!&mdash;yet ever with the same accursed face. I have prayed
      over these visitations. I, have sought in God's word that confirmation of
      my hope which should yet save me from despair; but, when rising from my
      supplications, the blest vision confronts me&mdash;the curse is ever there&mdash;thwarting
      its loveliness&mdash;reminding me of what was, but will never be again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a tattered Bible from his bosom and searched it intently. He was a
      sight at once forbidding and piteous, as he stood with wind-fluttered
      garments, his foot upon the edge of a frightful precipice, his head bent
      over the book as though devouring with his eyes some sacred antidote
      against the potency of his sorrow. Then he looked up, and the Bible fell
      from his hands. His eyes became fixed; he again clutched at the air, then
      fell back with a despairing gesture, averting his face the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of my sight!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Your eyes are lightning, and your smile is
      death. I will have no more of you&mdash;no more! And yet&mdash;O God! O
      God!&mdash;what dare I&mdash;what can I do without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He staggered back and made directly for the cavern. The watcher shrank
      back, while Herne the Hunter brushed blindly by, leaving Bible and rifle
      on the rock without. Then the wanderer, slipping out, fled down the narrow
      trail as though there were less peril from the dizzy cliffs around than in
      the society of the strange man whose fancies peopled these solitudes with
      such soul-harrowing phantoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for years Herne the Hunter had been a mystery, a fear, and a
      fascination to the mountaineers; recoiling from men, abhorring women,
      rebuffing curiosity, yet' at times strangely tender, sad, and ever
      morbidly religious. He clung to his Bible as his last earthly refuge from
      his darker self, and to the aspirations it engendered as a bane to the
      fatalistic stirrings within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a mighty hunter and lived upon the proceeds of his skill. Once or
      twice a year he would appear at some mountain store, fling down a package
      of skins, and demand its worth in powder and lead. The jean-clad loungers
      would regard him askance, few venturing to idly speak with him, and none
      repeating the experiment. His mien daunted the boldest. If women were
      there he would stand aloof until they left; on meeting them in the road he
      would sternly avert his eyes as though from a distasteful presence. One
      day the wife of a storekeeper, waiting on him in her husband's absence,
      ventured to say, while wrapping up his purchases:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've all'ays wonnered, Mr. Herne, what makes ye wanter git outen the
      wimmen folks' way? Mos' men likes ter have 'em eroun'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herne the Hunter frowned heavily, but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm shore, if ye had a good wife long with ye way up thar whur ye live,
      she'd make ye a leetle more like a man 'nd less like a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo; she
      hesitated over a term which might censure yet not give offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a beast you would say.&rdquo; He exclaimed then with vehemence: &ldquo;Were the
      necks of all women in one, and had I my hands on it, I'd strangle them
      all, though hell were their portion thereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture as of throttling a giant, snatched his bundle from the
      woman's hand and took himself off up the road with long strides.

    <p>
      That night was a stormy one. Herne the Hunter was covering the last ten
      miles between him and the Dismal in a pelting rain. The incident at the
      store, trivial as it was, had set his blood aflame. He prayed and fought
      against himself, oblivious of the elements and the darkness, sheltering
      his powder beneath his shirt of skins where his Bible lay secure. In his
      ears was the roar of wind and the groans of the tortured forest. Dark
      ravines yawned beside him, out of which the wolf howled and the mountain
      owl laughed; and once came a scream like a child, yet stronger and more
      prolonged. He knew the panther's voice, yet he heeded nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last another cry, unmistakably human, rose nearer by. Then he paused,
      like a hound over a fresher scent, until it was repeated. He made his way
      around a shoulder of the mountain, and aided by the gray light of a
      cloud-hidden moon, approached the figures of a woman, a boy and a horse,
      all three dripping and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! we will not die here, after all,&rdquo; exclaimed the female, as
      Herne the Hunter grimly regarded them. &ldquo;Oh, sir, we have missed the way.
      This boy was guiding me to the survey camp of Captain Renfro, my husband,
      on the upper Swananoa. He has sprained his foot, and we have been lost for
      hours. Can you take us to a place of shelter? I will pay you well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear a voice from the pit,&rdquo; said Herne, fiercely. &ldquo;It is the way with
      your sex. You think, though you sink the world, that with money you can
      scale Heaven. Stay here&mdash;rot&mdash;starve&mdash;perish&mdash;what
      care I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this amazing outburst he turned away, but her terror of the night
      overbore her fear of this strange repulse, and she grasped his arm. He
      shook himself free, though the thrill accompanying her clasp staggered
      him. For years no woman's hand had touched him; but at this rebuff she
      sank down, crying brokenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do? I should not have started. They warned me below, but I
      thought the boy knew the way. Oh, sir! if you have a heart, do not leave
      us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A heart!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What's that? A piece of flesh that breeds endless
      woes in bosoms such as yours. All men's should be of stone&mdash;as mine
      is now!&rdquo; He paused, then said abruptly: &ldquo;Up with you and follow me. I
      neither pity nor sympathize; but for the sake of her who bore me, I will
      give you such shelter as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the boy, who, knowing him, had sat stupefied with fear, and
      bade the woman follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the horse?&rdquo; she said, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The brute is the best among you, but whither we
      go no horse may follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, taking up the boy in his arms, and she dumbly followed him,
      trembling, faint, yet nerved by her fears to unusual exertion. So rapid
      was his gait, encumbered though he was, that she kept him in view with
      difficulty. Through the gloom she could divine the perils that environed
      their ever upward way. The grinding of stricken trees, the brawl of
      swollen waters harrowed her nerves not less than the partial gleams of
      unmeasured heights and depths revealed by the lightning. A sense of
      helplessness exaggerated these terrors among the unknown possibilities
      surrounding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as though they would never stop again. Her limbs trembled, her
      heart thumped suffocatingly, yet their guide gave no heed, but pressed on
      as though no shivering woman pantingly dogged his steps. They traveled
      thus for several miles. She felt herself giving way totally when, on
      looking up once more, she saw that the hunter had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she cried, and a voice, issuing seemingly out of the
      mountain-side, bade her come on. Her hands struck a wall of rock; on her
      right a precipice yawned; so, groping toward the left, she felt as she
      advanced that she was leaving the outer air; the wind and rain no longer
      beat upon her, yet the darkness was intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the voice of the boy calling upon her to keep near. Into the
      bowels of the mountains she felt her way until a gleam of light shone
      ahead. She hastened forward round a shoulder of rock into a roomy aperture
      branching from the main cavern. The boy lay upon a pallet of skins, while
      Herne the Hunter fixed the flaring pine-knot he had lighted into a crevice
      of the rock. Then he started a fire, drew out of another crevice some cold
      cooked meat and filled a gourd with water from a spring that trickled out
      at one end of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; he said, waving his hand. &ldquo;Eat&mdash;that ye may not die. The more
      unfit to live, the less prepared for death. Eat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he turned away and busied himself in bathing and bandaging the
      boy's foot, which, though not severely sprained, was for the time quite
      painful. Mrs. Renfro now threw back the hood of her waterproof and laid
      the cloak aside. Even old Herne&mdash;women hater that he was&mdash;could
      not have found fault with the matronly beauty of her face, unless with its
      expression of self-satisfied worldliness, as of one who judged others and
      herself solely by conventional standards, shaped largely by flattery and
      conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was hungry&mdash;her fears were somewhat allayed, and though rather
      disgusted at such coarse diet, ate and drank with some relish. Meanwhile,
      Herne the Hunter turned from the boy for something, and beheld her face
      for the first time. A water-gourd fell from his hands, his eyes dilated,
      and he crouched as he gazed like a panther before its unsuspecting prey.
      Every fibre of his frame quivered, and drops of cold sweat stood out upon
      his forehead. The boy saw with renewed fear this new phase of old Herne's
      dreaded idiosyncrasies. Mrs. Renfro at length raised her eyes and beheld
      him thus. Instantly he placed his hands before his face, and abruptly left
      the cavern. Alarmed at his appearance, she ran toward the boy, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>can</i> be the matter with him? Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knows more of him 'n I wants ter,&rdquo; replied the lad. &ldquo;Oh, marm, that's
      old Herne, 'nd we uns air the fust ones ez hev be'n in hyar whar he stays.
      I ganny! I thort shore he'd hev yeaten ye up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they do say ez the devil yowns him, not but what he air powerful
      'ligyus. No one knows much 'bouten him, 'cep'n' he's all'ays a projeckin'
      eround the Dismal whar no one yelse wants ter be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been here long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yurs 'nd yurs, they say.&rdquo; Tommy shook his head as though unable to
      measure the years during which Herne the Hunter had been acquiring his
      present unsavory reputation, but solved the riddle by exclaiming: &ldquo;I
      reckon he hev all'ays be'n that-a-way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour or more passed. Tommy fell asleep, while the lady sat musing by
      his side. She did not feel like sleeping, though much fatigued. Finally
      she heard a deep sigh behind her, and turning saw the object of her fears
      regarding her sombrely. The sight of her face appeared to shock him, for
      he turned half away as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have eaten the food that is the curse of life, in that it sustains
      it. Yet such we are. Sleep, therefore, for you have weary miles to go, ere
      you can reach the Swananoa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an indescribable sadness in his tone that touched her, and she
      regarded him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;and why do you choose to live in such a place
      as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask naught of me,&rdquo; he said, with an energy he seemed unable to repress.
      &ldquo;Ask rather of yourself who am I and how came I&mdash;thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck himself upon the breast, and without awaiting an answer again
      abruptly left the cave. She sat there wondering, trying to-weave into
      definite shape certain vague impressions suggested by his presence, until
      weariness overcame her and she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours after, Herne the Hunter reentered the cave, bearing a torch. His
      garments were wet, the rain-drops clung to his hair, and his face was more
      haggard than ever. He advanced towards the slumbering woman softly, and
      stood over her, gazing mournfully upon her, while large tears rolled down
      his cheeks. Then his expression changed to one that was stern and
      vindictive. His hand nervously toyed with the knife in his belt. Milder
      thoughts again seemed to sway him, and his features worked twitchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, I cannot,&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;The tears I thought
      forever banished from these eyes return at this sight. There has never
      been another who could so move me. Though thou hast been my curse, and art
      yet my hell&mdash;I cannot do it. Come! protector of my soul; stand thou
      between me and all murderous thoughts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his Bible from his bosom, kissed it convulsively, then held it as
      though to guard her from himself, and drawing backward slowly, he again
      fled into the storm and darkness without.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray light of morning rose over the Dismal, though within the cave the
      gloom still reigned supreme, when Herne the Hunter again stood at the
      entrance holding a flaring light. Then he said aloud: &ldquo;Wake, you that
      sleep under the shadow of death! Wake, eat, and&mdash;pass on!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Renfro aroused herself. The boy, however, slept on. Herne fixed his torch
      in the wall, and replenished the fire. Then he withdrew, apparently to
      give the lady privacy in making her toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was stiff in limb and depressed in mind. After washing at the spring,
      she wandered listlessly about the cave, surveying old Herne's scanty store
      of comforts. Suddenly she paused before a faded picture, framed in long,
      withered moss, that clung to an abutment of the rock. It was that of a
      girl, fair, slender and ethereal. There was a wealth of hair, large eyes,
      and features so faultless that the witching sense of self-satisfaction
      permeating them, added to rather than marred their loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady&mdash;glancing indifferently&mdash;suddenly felt a thrill and a
      pain. A deadly sense of recognition nearly overcame her, as this memento&mdash;confronting
      her like a resurrected chapter of the past&mdash;made clear the hitherto
      inexplicable behavior of their host. She recovered, and looked upon it
      tenderly, then shook her head gently and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot recognize it!&rdquo; said a deep voice behind her. &ldquo;You dare not!
      For the sake of your conscience&mdash;your hope in heaven&mdash;your fear
      of hell&mdash;you dare not recognize and look upon me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look round, though she knew that Herne the Hunter stood
      frowning behind, but trembled in silence as he went on with increasing
      energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that face remind you of? See you aught beneath that beauty but
      treachery without pity, duplicity without shame? Lo! the pity and the
      shame you should have felt have recoiled upon me&mdash;me, who alone have
      suffered.&rdquo; He broke off abruptly, as though choked by emotion. She dared
      not face him; she felt incapable of a reply. After a pause, he resumed,
      passionately: &ldquo;Oh! Alice, Alice! The dead rest, yet the living dead can
      only endure. Amid these crags, and throughout the solitude of years, I
      have fought and refought the same old battle; but with each victory it
      returns upon me, strengthened by defeat, while with me all grows weaker
      but the remorselessness of memory and the capacity for pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still stood, with bowed head, shivering as though his words were
      blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Does that picture of your own youth
      recall no vanished tenderness for one who&mdash;self-outcast of men&mdash;fell
      to that pass through you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a husband,&rdquo; she murmured, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and because of that husband I have no wife&mdash;no wife&mdash;no
      wife!&rdquo; His wailing repetition seemed absolutely heartbroken; but sternly
      he continued: &ldquo;You have told me where he is. I say to you&mdash;hide him&mdash;hide
      him from me! Even this&rdquo;&mdash;he struck his bosom with his Bible
      feverishly&mdash;&ldquo;may not save him. I have prayed and wrought, but it is
      as nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;when I think&mdash;when I remember.
      Therefore, hide him from me&mdash;lest I slay him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not&mdash;you dare not harm him!&rdquo; She faced him now, a splendid
      picture of an aroused wife and mother. &ldquo;He is not to blame&mdash;he knew
      you not&mdash;he has been good to me&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I love
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrank from the last words as though from a blow, and stood cowering.
      Then he hissed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me not find him. Hide him&mdash;hide him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tommy here awoke with a yawn, and announced that his foot was about well.
      Herne, closing his lips, busied himself about preparing breakfast, which
      cheerless meal was eaten in silence. When they finally emerged from the
      cave the sun was peeping into the Dismal below them; bright gleams chased
      the dark shadows down the cliffs, and the morning mists were melting. The
      storm was over; there was a twitter of birds, the tinkle of an overflowing
      burn, and a squirrel's bark emphasizing the freshness of the morn. The
      pure air entered the lips like wine, and Mrs. Renfro felt her depression
      roll off as they retraced the devious trail of the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the lady's horse standing dejectedly near where he had been
      left. The fog, in vast rolls, was climbing out of the Dismal, disclosing
      dark masses of forest below. The flavor of pine and balsam slept beneath
      the trees, every grass blade was diamond-strewn, and every sound vivified
      by the sense of mighty walls and unsounded depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mrs. Renfro had mounted, Herne the Hunter swept an arm around. The
      scene was savage and sombre, despite the sunlight. The intensity of the
      solitude about them dragged upon the mind like a weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;this is my world. I can tolerate no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inwardly shuddered; then a wave of old associations swept over her
      mind. Beneath the austerity of the man, beyond his selfish nurture of
      affliction, she&mdash;for the moment&mdash;remembered him as he once was,
      homely, kindly, enthusiastic and true. Had <i>she</i> indeed changed him
      to this? Or was it not rather the imperativeness of a passion, unable to
      endure or forget her preference of another? Whatever the cause, her heart
      now ached for him, though she feared him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You were not made to live thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I dare not. It will take months to undo the misery of this
      meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not name him!&rdquo; he cried fiercely; then abruptly lowering his tone, he
      said, with infinite sadness: &ldquo;Ask me no more. Yonder, by that white cliff,
      lies the Swan-anoa trail you missed yesterday. The kindest thing you can
      do is to forget that you have seen me. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and swung himself down the mountain-side into the Dismal.
      She saw the rolling mists close over him, and remained motionless in a
      reverie so deep that the boy spoke twice to her before she turned her
      horse's head and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the surveyor's camp lay the Swananoa Gap, a gloomy, precipitous
      gorge through which the river lashed itself into milder reaches below.
      Mrs. Renfro found her husband absent. With a single assistant he had
      started for the upper defiles, intending to be gone several days. They
      told her that he would endeavor to secure the services of Herne the Hunter
      as a guide, as one knowing more of that wilderness than any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was fresh food for wifely alarm. Herne had never met her husband, yet
      the latter's name would make known his relationship to herself. She
      shuddered over the possibilities that might result from their sojourn
      together&mdash;far from aid&mdash;in those wild mountains, and made
      herself wretched for a week in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the transient fine weather passed; the rains once more
      descended, and the peaks of Nantahalah were invisible for days amid a
      whirl of vapor. The boom of the river, the grinding of forest limbs, the
      shriek of the wind, made life unusually dreary at the camp. She lay awake
      one night when the elements were apparently doing their worst. Her husband
      was still absent&mdash;perhaps alone with a possible maniac, raving over
      the memory of fancied wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally another sound mingled with and at last overmastered all others&mdash;something
      between a crash and a roar, interblended with sullen jars and grindings.
      Near and nearer it came. She sprang to the tent-floor and found her feet
      in the water. The darkness was intense. What could be the matter? Fear
      overcame her resolution and she shrieked aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man bearing a lantern burst into the tent with a hoarse cry. Its gleams
      showed her Herne the Hunter, drenched, draggled, a ghastly cut across his
      face, with the blood streaming down, his long hair flying, and in his eyes
      a fierce flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared I would not find you,&rdquo; he shouted, for the roar without was now
      appalling. &ldquo;It is a cloud-burst above. In five minutes this hollow will be
      fathoms deep. The tents lower down are already gone. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seized and was bearing her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save&mdash;alarm the others!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You first&mdash;Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that dread moment she detected the hopelessness with which he called
      her thus, as though such recognition was wrung from his lips by the pain
      he hugged, even while it rended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband?&rdquo; she gasped, growing faint over the thought of his possible
      peril&mdash;or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe,&rdquo; he hissed through his clenched teeth, for his exertions were
      tremendous. With a fierce flap the tent was swept away as they left it.
      About his knees the waters swirled, while limbs and other floating débris
      swept furiously by.
    </p>
    <p>
      What seemed to her minutes&mdash;though really seconds&mdash;passed amid a
      terrific jumble of sounds, while the rain fell in sheets. It seemed as
      though the invisible mountains were dissolving. They were, however, slowly
      rising above the floods. She heard Herne's hard breathing, and felt his
      wild heart-throbs as he held her close. Something heavy struck them, or
      rather him, for he shielded her. One of his arms fell limp, and he groaned
      heavily. Then she swooned away, with a fleeting sensation of being grasped
      by some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when she revived, there was a great hush in the air. Below, the
      river gently brawled-; there was a misty darkness around, and the gleam of
      a lantern held before a dear and familiar form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husband&mdash;is it you?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Captain Renfro, &ldquo;I thought I had lost you. You owe your
      life to Herne the Hunter. In fact, but for him I would have been
      overwhelmed myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asked feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men are searching for him. Just as one of them got hold of you, he
      fell back&mdash;something must have struck him, and the flood swept him
      off. I tell you, Alice, that man&mdash;crazy or not&mdash;is a hero. We
      were on our way down and had camped above the Gap, when the cloud-burst
      came. We knew you all would be overwhelmed before we could get round here
      by the trail; so what does Herne do but send us on horseback by land,
      while he scoots down that Canyon in a canoe&mdash;little better than an
      eggshell. Risked his life in that awful place to get here in time. I
      insisted on going with him at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like you, George,&rdquo; said the wife fondly, though in her mind's eye
      came a vision of Herne the Hunter battling with that Niagara to save and
      unite the two, through whom his own life had been made a burden. She
      sighed and clasped her husband's hand, while he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a fool, I expect, for the canoe would have swamped under both of
      us. He knew this, and ordered me off with a look I did not like; there was
      madness in it. Well, we hurried round by the trail with, one lantern;
      Herne took the other. When we got here, you were apparently dead, Herne
      and two of the men swept off&mdash;the camp gone from below, and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cry was now heard. Several men hastened down, and soon lights were seen
      returning. Four of them bore Herne the Hunter. One arm and a leg were
      broken, and his skull crushed in; yet the wonderful vitality of the man
      had kept him alive and sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We found him clinging to a sapling,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;But he's about gone&mdash;poor
      fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow, indeed! Mrs. Renfro felt the lumps rise in her throat as she
      gazed upon that wreck, and thought. Presently Herne opened his eyes&mdash;already
      filling with the death-mist&mdash;and his gaze fell upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;my troubles&mdash;are over. This&rdquo;&mdash;he tugged
      at something in his bosom with his uninjured arm, when some one drew forth
      his Bible, drenched and torn&mdash;&ldquo;this saved me. I could have killed him&mdash;&rdquo;
       he glanced at Renfro, who amid his pity now wondered. &ldquo;I could&mdash;but&mdash;I
      saved you. And&mdash;now&mdash;Jesus&mdash;have mercy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were his last words, for in another minute Herne the Hunter was a
      thing of the past, and a weeping woman bent over him. After that there was
      silence for a while. Then the wife said to her husband, while the others
      removed the dead man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was his misfortune, not my fault, that he loved me. Has he not made
      amends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the husband, with his hands clasped in hers, could find no other heart
      than to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;most nobly!&rdquo;
     </p>

      UNCLE DUKE'S &ldquo;B'AR&rdquo; STORY, By Lillian Gilfillan
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> 'LOWED ez mebbe
      you uns ud like ter hear thet thar b'ar story. I reckon it's ten year this
      December since it all happened. I war a-livin' up in thet house on th'
      edge uv th' corn fiel' 'long side th' branch, an' ef it 't'warn't fer thet
      b'ar I'd be a-livin' thar yet, 'stead uv a-settin' in th' warm corner uv
      Jim Ladd's fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      I 'low ez yer knowed Jim didn't hev no great sight uv worldly efects when
      he married Becky Crabtree; I don't reckon his daddy war able ter do much
      fer him, 'ceptin' 'lowin' him the use uv thet yoke uv ole steers uv his'n.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thet war afore they moved th' mill out'n th' holler yander, so it war
      right handy fer Jim ter haul his logs ter, an' he jes' worked hisse'f
      plumb nigh ter death a-gettin' up thet leetle log house uv his'n, an'
      a-plantin' fruit trees an' sech, an' all summer Becky worked jes' ez hard
      a-berry pickin', tendin' her truck patch an' a-peddlin' up ter th'
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      An' in th' winter time when Jim war a-makin' dish shelves an' a-puttin'
      some new splits inter th' bottoms uv them ole chiers his daddy give him,
      Becky war a-peecin' quilts an' a-spinnin' cloth fer dresses. Waal, in th'
      spring they war married an' went ter live in ther house on th' side uv th'
      mounting, out'n no neighbors, 'ceptin' me, fer a mile or more down th'
      cove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thet war th' spring I war tuck so bad with this misery in my back an'
      afore summer I war so cript up I warn't no 'count whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      One mornin' jes' ez I war a gettin' up from afore the fire whar I hed been
      a-eatin' a snack uv breakfast, Becky walked in, lookin' ez fresh ez a
      fiel' uv early corn, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Duke, I 'lowed I'd come in an' see how you war an' rid up a leetle
      fur yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I h'ant never been used ter wimen folks, an' I could'nt git th' consent uv
      my mind ter set by an' see every thin' pot out'n its nat'ral place, so I
      reched my stick an' out'n sayin' nothin' I riz up an' went out under th'
      big gum tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      It warn't long afore Becky kem out with her bucket on her arm, an' sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Uncle Duke. I reckon I'll be a-gittin' along ter th' berry
      patch yan-der.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sed, &ldquo;Thank yer, Becky. Don't yer come no more ter tend ter me. I 'low
      you's got a plenty ter do 'out'n a-doin' thet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yer see, I didn't want ter be pestered with her fixin', yit she was so
      obleegin' ter everybody I didn't want ter 'fend her by axin' her ter stay
      ter hum. Waal, when I went in an' seed how piert things looked, I jes'
      wished I'd a-kep' my pipe in my mouth 'stead uv a-jawin' her. Spite uv my
      sayin' time an' ag'in fer her ter rest when her own work war done, she
      kep' a-comin'. I 'lowed she seed how much I enjoyed havin' things liken
      white folks lived in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I 'low she war jes' ez bright an' happy thet year ez enny woman in the
      cove ez hed a plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An' summer an' winter she 'peared ter be always a-workin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waal in th' middle uv March leetle Jim kem, and I reckon thar warn't no
      two happier people in th' world. They war proud uv thet baby, an' no
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fust time I seed Becky arter it war born, she pulled a leetle hand
      out'n from under th' kiver an' sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Duke, some day thet leetle han'll chop wood fur his mammy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waal, it did'nt look much like handlin' an axe thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thet summer she use ter roll th' baby up in her daddie's ole army blanket
      an' take it with her berry pickin' an' peddlin' an' everywhars; it 'peared
      like she didn't think its weight nothin', un' she'd go 'long th' road
      talkin' ter it like ez ef a baby four months ole knowed ennythin'. With
      th' money from her berries she bought th' winter clothes&mdash;mostely
      things fur th' baby an' flannel shirts fur her man&mdash;'peared like she
      thought th' cold wouldn't tech her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It war th' last uv th' next June thet th' twins war born. This time Becky
      didn't seem ter git 'long so piert&mdash;jes' lay still an' pale like, an'
      a lookin' at the baby gals sad an' pityin'. I reckon she war a wonderin'
      whar th' warm winter clothes they'd need by' an' by' war ter be got from.
      It warn't in reason ter 'spose a woman could tote two babies an' do much
      at pickin' berries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim worked ez hard ez enny man could, but his ole mare died jist at fodder
      pickin' time, an' he couldn't do much out'n a critter, so a right smart uv
      his crap war lost. Becky didn't seem ter get strong ez she did afore, an'
      her sister up an' left her sooner 'en she oughter. She seemed tar be
      kinder mad all th' time ter think Becky had gone an' hed twins, an' she
      didn't keep her 'pinions hid. I reckon Becky warn't sorry when she went
      back ter her man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ez I war a-sayin', it war ten year ago this December, an' a right smart uv
      snow on th' ground, when Becky came by my house one mornin' ter ax me ef
      I'd go down an' watch th' fire an' leetle Jim fer a spell. I seed she war
      lookin' anxious like, an' I axed her what war th' matter. &ldquo;Jim went
      a-rabbit huntin' yesterday evenin',&rdquo; she sed, &ldquo;an' he ain't kem hum yit; I
      reckon somethin' hes happened ter him, an' I 'lowed I'd go an' see. The
      babies ez both asleep an' I speck ter be home afore long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on up th' mounting path a-makin' fur the top, a-holpin' herse'f
      over the sleek places with that hickory stick uv her'n.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on down ter th' house an' found leetle Jim a-noddin' afore th'
      fire. It war about'n th' time he always tuck his nap. Pretty soon he war
      ez sound asleep ez ef he war on th' biggest feather bed in th' cove,
      'stead uv jes' his mammy's cook apron under his little yaller head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pot on a fresh log an' was mighty nigh asleep myse'f when one o' th'
      babies waked up an' cried a leetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow I got th' cradle in an awk'ard place acrost a plank ez war all
      warped up an' th' churnin' back an' fore waked up th' t'other 'un. She
      jes' lay thar a-look-in' fust at me an' then at her leetle sister, kinder
      onsartin whether ter cry or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an' by I thought I'd holp her back ter sleep, so I tuck her leetle han'
      an' tried ter pot her thumb in ter her mouth, but thar warn't nobody
      knowed enny better thin thet thar baby thet she didn't want no thumb
      feedin'. I got up an' went fur some milk, fust a-lookin' out'n th' door
      ter see ef Becky war a-comin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seein' ez thar warn't no sign uv her no-whar, I 'lowed I try ter feed th'
      young uns, beein's th' both uv them war a-doin' ther best at cryin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn't seem ter take much ter my feedin'; I reckon thet war 'cause I
      didn't set th' milk afore th' fire fust, an' somehow it 'peared like' th'
      milk most in general went down th' outside uv ther necks; an' Annie (that
      war th' little un) kept a chokin' tell I had ter take her up. Jes' ez soon
      ez thet leetle critter got whar she could look 'round an' sense things,
      she 'peared quite satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I managed ter git t'other un (Fannie) out'n the cradle. They jumped an'
      twisted tell I thought I'd die uv the misery in my back, but whin I pot
      them down they yelled like hallelujer!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Peard like they'd kept me a-dancin' a powerful long time, whin I heerd
      voices an' I 'lowed Becky war come, but it turned out ter be Mitch
      Pendergrass an' Sonk Levan, with some rabbits an' ther guns. They hed
      stopped by ter git warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whin they seed me a-settin' thar nussin' two babies ter onct they bust out
      larfin'. Fannie hed holt uv my left year an' the leetle hair I hed on my
      head. Annie war a-sittin' on my knee a gazin' at Sonk an' Mitch,
      a-wonderin' why they war a-larfin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low, Uncle Duke,&rdquo; sez Sonk, &ldquo;ez yer've tuck ter lamin' nussin' late in
      life. It shows yer pluck ter commence on two ter onct. Whar's Becky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She air gone ter look fer Jim,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;He went out a-huntin' last night
      an' he ain't never come hum this mornin'. She war oneasy 'bout him an'
      went out ter look fur him. 'Lowed ez she'd be hum afore this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mitch went ter the door an' looked out an' thin cornin' back ter th' fire,
      sez he:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's arter twelve o'clock, nigh ez I kin calkerlate. Thar seems ter be a
      big black cloud a-hangin' over th' Top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becky ought'en ter be out in no sich. I reckon we'd better be a-movin'.
      Mebbe Jim's happened ter an acci<i>tent</i> an' she's a-tryin' ter holp
      him by herse'f.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's plucky, <i>she</i> is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; sez Sonk, &ldquo;Mitch, you give Uncle Duke a lesson in baby feedin'
      (the father uv ten ought'n ter know somethin' bout'n thet business); I'll
      tote in enough wood ter burn a spell, an' thin we'll light out'n hyar an'
      hunt up Becky an' Jim.&rdquo; Arter Mitch's learnin' me ter hold th' spoon un'
      ter warm th' milk an' ter pot in sweetenin' me an' th' babies got on fine.
      Soon I hed them both sleepin', kivered up ter th' years, an' th' cradle
      sot in a warm place. Then I began ter feel powerful hungry, an' leetle
      Jim, though he ain't sed nothin', hed been a-watchin' thet thar spoon an'
      milk cup while I fed th' babies, an' a openin' his mouth long side uf
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I skun one uv Sonk's rabbits, an' it warn't no time tel th' corn bread war
      a-cookin' in th' bake pan an' th' rabbit a-jumpin' up in th' grease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arter dinner Jim set on my knee jes' ez quiet, never axin' fer his mammy
      onct, an' thim babies slept on jes' like they knowed they war twins an'
      ther mammy gone. Pretty soon it began ter get dark an' th' snow war
      a-fallin' ag'in a leetle. Jim went ter sleep an' I pot him ter bed. The
      time 'peared ter go powerful slow arter that, an' I began ter nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been eight o'clock whin voices in th' yard waked me. I opened
      th' door an' Mitch called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stir up the fire an' give us a leetle more light. Thar ain't no bones
      broke, but Jim don't feel egsactly piert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They brung him in an' his face war jes' ez pale an' he looked powerful
      weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of his coat war tore of'en him an' th' blood war a-droppin' from a
      place in his arm. Becky looked plumb wore out, but th' fust thin' she did
      soon ez Jim war on th' bed war ter lean over th' cradle an' sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Duke, war my babies good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes' ez good ez two leetle angels,&rdquo; I sed, spitin' th' fact th' side uv
      my head war pretty sore from ther pullin' an' scratchin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      She helped ter git Jim's arm wrapped up an' him warm in bed, an' thin
      began ter get supper, like nothin' hed happened out'n th' common. Whin I
      seed how pale she looked, I sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jus' yer git out th' plates an' I'll tend the fire. I 'low arter cookin'
      fer nigh thirty year, I kin git a snack yer can eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It twarn't long until another rabbit war in th' pan an' th' coffee
      a-boilin'. Jim looked up whin he smelt the cookin' an' sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon we'll hev a little bigger meat fer to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I war jes' ez curious ez enny ole woman, but everybody was so tired an'
      hungry I didn't ax anny questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becky war a-sittin' in a low chier afore th' fire with leetle Jim on her
      lap a-warm-in' his leetle feet in her han'. I could see th' tears war
      a-chasin' each other down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mon! but they did eat. Jim, too, and I had' ter git th' cold meat left
      from dinner ter hev enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they hed got up from th' table Sonk sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitch, your wife'll need you with all thim chil'n; I 'low you'd better be
      a-goin'. I reckon I'll stop hyer; step by an' tell Sallie ter hev
      breakfast early, an' tell leetle Lular pappy'll be home in th' mornin'.
      You hev th' mules ready early; I am afeard uv th' varmints a-gittin'
      Becky's game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arter Mitch war gone an' things picked up they told me ther story.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pears like thar warn't no trouble in a trackin' Becky up ter th' top, an'
      they found her a-tryin' ter work Jim out'n a hole in th' bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th' night afore, jes' ez Jim war a-makin' fur hum with his game, he hed
      run agin' a big b'ar. He up an' fired, but missed, it bein' most dark. The
      b'ar war on him afore he could load agin, an' makin' a pass at him with
      its big paw, knocked th' musket out'n his han's an' bruck it plumb in two.
      Jim hed jes' time ter make up a saplin' an' Mr. B'ar set down under him
      ter bide his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sot thar a long spell, an' it war most midnight, nigh ez Jim could
      tell, whin the b'ar made off an' lay down, seein' Jim warn't willin' ter
      come down an' be et. Waal, Jim decided thin he would come down an' run fur
      it, 'lowin' a hot chase war better'n freezin' up thar. So down he dumb an'
      lit out, Mr. B'ar arter him. Jes' ez they struck the bluff path the b'ar
      got so near thet it riz up an' grabbed him. Jim bein' quick got away,
      leavin' Mr. B'ar most uv his coat ter 'member him by, but in backin' away
      he wint too far an' fell inter a crack in th' bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It warn't very nice failin', but the crack warn't over four feet deep an'
      full uv leaves at the bottom, so bein' out'n the wind they made a more
      comfortable place ter spend th' night in then th' saplin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon Jim hed occasion ter know he war hurt some.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bar had tore his left arm right smart an' in fallin' his face hed got
      skun up dreadful. Th' b'ar walked up an' down, a-smellin' down thet crack
      sorter much like, but by-an'-by he went off a leetle an' lay down, I spect
      arguin' with hisse'f thet Jim would come out'n th' hole liken he did out'n
      th' saplin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim wrapped up his arm the best he could with a piece uv his shirt sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      It war daylight when he waked an' th' fust thin' he seed war th' head uv
      thet thar b'ar a-lookin' down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knowed it war'n't no use ter holler, so he jes' lay thar thinkin' 'bout
      Becky an' th' babies an' leetle Jim&mdash;wonderin' ef she'd think he'd
      quit her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought uv Becky's thinkin' enny bad uv him made him groan with a new
      kind uv pain, an' whin he moved a leetle he fainted away. I reckon thet
      war jes' 'bout'n th' time Becky got thar, fer she said she heerd a groan
      down in thet hole an' thin all war still. She war jes' a-goin' ter call
      whin she spied thet b'ar a-lookin' down inter th' crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bout ten foot to th' left uv whar Jim war fust the mounting breaks away,
      leavin' a pres'pus uv forty foot or more, but thar's a leetle ledge at th'
      top whar you kin look inter thet crack in th' bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It war fur thet leetle ledge the b'ar made jes' ez Becky halted. When it
      clumb down she made sure it would git ter Jim (she war sure he war in thet
      crack), so she follered quiet ez she could, an th' snow bein' soft kept
      th' b'ar from hearing her&mdash;until she war right behind it&mdash;whar
      it war leanin' down over th' edge a-tryin' ter git inter th' crack. 'Fore
      it could turn on her she gave it a powerful push with her hickory stick,
      an' being so fur over an' so heavy the b'ar lost hisse'f, an' down he went
      with a crash into th' underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becky'd gone too, only her dress war caught in some bushes an' thet saved
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She couldn't do nothin' but lay on th' ground an' rest a spell, thin she
      crawled ter th' edge an' looked down ter make sure th' b'ar war dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearin' Jim groan agin she got up an' went ter him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He war clean gone in a faint agin before she could get down ter him. When
      she got him to again she gave him th' flask uv milk she hed brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She worked with him ter keep him warm, but she couldn't do much, th' place
      war so norrow. It seemed an age before he got so he knowed anythin', an'
      she had made up her mind ter leave him an' go fur help whin Sonk and Mitch
      got thar. An' 'twixt 'm they soon got Jim out an' laid him on the ole army
      blanket I hed sent, an' they axed Becky how come he thar. She told them
      what she knowed, but they wouldn't believe about th' b'ar until she showed
      them whar it lay. Whin Mitch looked over an' seed fur hisse'f he jis' sed
      'By Gosh!' an' runnin' back to whar he could scramble down made down th'
      side like a coon. Sonk war about ter follow, when he stopped an' turned
      ter Becky, tellin' her ter see ter Jim till they could come up agin. He
      give her a bottle uv applejack out'n his pocket, which he said he carried
      fur snake bite. Becky never said nothin' 'bout'n snakes most in general
      stayin' in th' ground in winter time, but gave a little of the liquor ter
      Jim an' tuck a leetle dram herse'f.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon ef it hadn't been fer Sonk's snake medicine, they both a-been
      down sick from th' cold an' wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ez soon ez th' men could git a good kiverin' uv snow over th' b'ar ter
      keep wild cats from pesterin' it, they kem up an' took up th' ends uv
      Jim's blanket ter fotch him hum. It war slow work, th' path bein' steep
      an' norrow, an' Jim heavy, so it war eight o'clock afore they got down.
      Waal, th' next day they got th' bar down, an' mon! he war a big 'un.
    </p>
    <p>
      They skun him an' put th' meat up fur sale at th' store. A young fellar
      from th' North ez war a-stayin' at th' station give Becky $12 fur th'
      hide, ter take home ter his gal, I reckon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meat sold well, an' altergether I reckon Becky never seed so much
      money at one time afore in her life. She wanted ter divide with Sonk an'
      Mitch, but they wouldn't hear to it, an' she couldn't make them took nary
      cent. Afore th' week war out she went ter th' station an' bought shoes an'
      warm clothes fur all an' enough ter last two winters, an' soon Becky's
      fingers war busy. She made some red flannel shirts fur me, 'cause she sed
      they be good fer th' misery in my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      An' whin I sed my fire hed been out a week an' I'd eat enough uv other
      folks' corn bread an' coffee, Becky up and sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low ez yer'd better stay, Uncle Duke; I've got a sight uv sewin' ter
      do an' yer got ter be so handy with th' babies I can't hardly spare yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arter thet we jined corn fiel's an' next year war a powerful good one fer
      craps an' fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tended th' chil'n while Becky went fur berries and did her peddlin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ain't a-gettin' rich, but we has a plenty, an' I don't reckon we air
      got anythin' in a worldly line to ax th' Lord fur he ain't already done
      give us.

    <p>
      We had been expressing our individual opinions about men and things,
      especially men, and had derived a sleepy satisfaction from our general
      criticisms. There were men among us who had seen a good deal of frontier
      life, and, as one man said, &ldquo;he had seen so many men die with their boots
      on, it seemed the natural end.&rdquo; My nearest neighbor in the circle was a
      young artist from New Orleans, known throughout the city as &ldquo;Jim the
      Painter,&rdquo; from the art he practiced to get his living. He turned and asked
      me if I knew Jack Dunton; and when I denied the honor, he said: &ldquo;Well, you
      ought to; he is a map of the whole Indian country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This awakened my interest. I found that Dunton was living in San Antonio,
      that his life had been really wonderful in experiences and adventures,
      that he was very intelligent as well as recklessly brave, and finally,
      that his acquaintance was worth any man's time to cultivate. Later in the
      evening we walked over to Dunton's office, a long, pleasant room in the
      second story of a flat-roofed <i>adobe</i> building that covered nearly
      half an acre. Both its stories were crammed full of the goods he sold&mdash;wagons,
      harnesses, and all sorts of agricultural tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dunton's own room was a mighty interesting place, principally in its
      decorations. The walls and doorways were hung with bright-colored and
      strange-figured Mojave and Navajoe blankets, skins and weapons were
      scattered around or arranged as trophies, while clumsy and rude implements
      of Aztec and Mexican fashioning, from Yucatan to Chihuahua, were suspended
      against the sides, or heaped in the corners. A large open fire, with
      blazing cedar logs, filled the room with the aromatic odor so pleasant and
      characteristic of that wood, and lighted it with fitful glares. There were
      many interesting stories connected with this collection, and every article
      in the room seemed to remind Dunton of an experience or incident in his
      varied career. After being introduced and comfortably seated in a chair,
      he passed us cigars, and while we were lighting these preliminaries to
      sociability he drew a square of corn husk from one side-pocket of his sack
      coat and a pinch of tobacco from the other side-pocket, and quietly rolled
      a cigarette, which gave out a pungent, penetrating odor. It was not
      disagreeable, but it struck me as being peculiar, even for Texas. Upon
      remarking that it seemed different from ordinary tobacco, Dunton replied,
      &ldquo;It is, and I have good reason to like it, for once it saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This aroused my curiosity, and with some little urging he told us the
      story. &ldquo;This tobacco,&rdquo; said Dunton, &ldquo;comes from the town of Carcinto,
      quite a mining settlement of <i>adobe</i> houses and stockades,
      surrounding a Mexican convict station in the center of the state of
      Chihuahua. It is made by the convicts, who treat the ordinary tobacco with
      the juice of a native plant, which gives it the pungent flavor you notice
      and, I suspect, a slight narcotic power; be that as it may, now that I am
      used to it, other tobacco is flat and tasteless. I was down there some
      years ago, trying to sell the mine-owners some carts, harness, and things
      in my line, and I became well acquainted with the nature of these
      convicts, and I tell you, I would rather take my chances in a den of
      mountain lions than among those fellows when they revolt. At such times
      they are madly insane, and nothing is too hellish for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had made a good thing of my deal and was anxiously waiting for an
      escort,&mdash;for I had four thousand Mexican dollars, and a man of my
      shape takes no chances in toting money around in that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day that I remember particularly&mdash;and you will see I have reason
      to&mdash;was the day before I was to go out from the mine with the mule
      train. That afternoon I went in the levels with Senor Bustino, one of the
      owners, a gentleman, every inch of him&mdash;and I tell you, no finer
      gentleman walks the earth than a high-caste Mexican of Castilian blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had sold them a few dozen American pickaxes, and one of the convict
      gangs was to try them that day for the first time. It was the first lot of
      pickaxes ever used in that mine, and, as the sequel proved, the last. The
      men were doing with them twice the business they had formerly done with
      their clumsy heavy hoes. Two soldiers with <i>escopetas</i> were on guard,
      and two overseers with pistols and heavy canes were directing the work. To
      get a better and nearer view, Sefior Bustino and I crowded through until
      we came to the rotten ledge filled with the silver, upon which they
      worked. The convicts stopped and gazed upon us curiously, some of them
      pushing back their long black hair out of their eyes and staring with
      undisguised wonder at me, for I was a <i>gringo</i>, a <i>heretico</i>,
      and a strange object to them in those early days, with my paler skin and
      peculiar dress. Near me was a large black fellow, bare to the waist.. He
      was short-necked and broad-shouldered, and his cheeks were so high as to
      partly close his little fierce eyes; his nose was low and flat, while his
      chin was sharp and prominent, with a deep scowl; in fact, a bundle of
      animal appetites and passions done up in a hideous form. As we passed he
      drew from the folds of his drawers&mdash;the only clothing he wore&mdash;a
      pinch of tobacco and a com husk, and making a cigarette he stepped to one
      of the grease-wood torches and lighted it, blowing out a great cloud of
      pungent, aromatic smoke from his broad nostrils, that filled the space
      around us with the odor you noticed from my cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my first experience with that tobacco, and, indeed, my first
      smell of its peculiar odor, and I have never forgotten it. I dined that
      evening with the old senor and was introduced to his family; his wife, a
      Mexican lady prematurely aged&mdash;as they all are, two daughters,
      handsome as angels, and was shown the picture of their son, a young man
      who was then being educated in Paris. They were delightful people,
      especially to one who had been trucking for weeks across the dusty plains
      of Chihuahua, with only <i>peons</i> and mules for company, and we had a
      fiery Mexican dinner, spiced with the jokes of the village priest, who was
      an honored guest. At ten, with the hearty wishes of the whole family, and
      after the elaborate Mexican custom of withdrawal, I left them. As I
      sauntered out in the moonlight I could not shut out of my mind the brutish
      face of the convict in the mine. Perhaps the round faces and handsome eyes
      of the senor's pretty daughters may have emphasized the memory of the
      convict's ugly head; otherwise I was in a happy mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned the corner of the street and entered a short dark lane that led
      toward the prison stockade. There was an occasional <i>adobe</i> house,
      but the street was mostly lined with the miserable mud <i>jacals</i> of
      the poorer Mexicans. I had hardly gotten well into it when I sniffed the
      same pungent odor that the convict's cigarette had given out. It startled
      me a trifle, conjuring up, as it did, the hideous mental picture of the
      man. I had but just realized this association when I heard the clanging of
      the cathedral bells in that hurried, nervous manner which has alarm in its
      every note&mdash;for the tone of a bell always partakes of the state that
      its ringer is in. I heard the sound of approaching voices, loud and
      fierce, mixed with the alarming notes of the bells, and I stepped into the
      dark doorway of the nearest house. Next, there was the spatting of bare
      feet on the hard street, and a yelling crowd hurriedly rushed by my
      hiding-place, leaving a trailing smell of the same tobacco. I noticed the
      gleam of white handles in the moon-lighted street that I had seen in the
      yellow light of the mine, and then I knew that the convicts had revolted,
      and that they were armed with the pick-axes I had sold the mining company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bells continued to clang out their terror, and the distant shouting
      became blended into the continuous murmur that you hear from a distant
      crowd of excited people. Once in a while the roar of an <i>escopeta</i>
      would be heard, and soon I saw a magenta glow in the sky, and I knew the
      town had been fired. Then followed the rapid snapping of pistols, and soon
      the bellow of the old brass <i>escopetas</i> denoted that the guards had
      mustered, and that there was an organized resistance to the revolt. All
      this occurred quicker than I can tell it. I concluded to get back into the
      broad street I had just come out of, for if there is to be shooting, I
      want a clear space and as much light as I can get.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I turned the corner, on a run, with both of my colts on a
      shooting level&mdash;for, by the way, it is always best to come upon your
      enemy suddenly and surprise him before he knows you are there&mdash;I saw
      several bodies in the street, and in the distance some dozen men
      retreating. I stopped near by the first body I came to; and to my horror I
      saw it was the still warm corpse of Senor Bustino. As I paused and stooped
      to more closely examine, I thought I could detect the lingering smell of
      that hellish convict's tobacco. Had the fiends attacked my host's home and
      dragged him insensate through the streets, or had he been slain whilst
      hurrying to the post of duty, at the sound of the alarm he knew well the
      meaning of? If the former, good God! what had been the fate of his wife
      and lovely daughters? The very thought momentarily unnerved me; and if the
      convicts had not yet wreaked their vengeance, could I reach them in time
      to be of effective service? Louder and louder roared the tumult, nearer
      and nearer came the flashing, glinting lights of torch and pistol, and as
      I swept round into the street in which Senor Bustino's house stood I could
      see, pouring down the hill toward it, a demoniac gang led by the
      bare-breasted convict whose baleful face had haunted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found the senora and her daughters alone and, thank God! unharmed; but
      not a moment too soon, for even as I hurried them through into the
      darkness of the night the convicts, with curses on their tongues, lust in
      their heart, and red ruin in their hands, swarmed into the house. A
      momentary check came as their leader and another fell in the narrow door,
      beneath the fire of my two revolvers, and the flames which leaped up from
      that erewhile home lent their last protection in the shadow they cast,
      which enabled us, by availing ourselves of it, to escape. By the time we
      arrived at my hotel the convicts had flown to the mountains and we heard
      the story of the revolt. If I had not smelled that tobacco I should not
      have concealed myself in the doorway, my life would not have been worth a
      picayune, and you may imagine what would have been the fate of my hostess
      and her household. Senor Bustino, it appeared, had fallen a victim to the
      high chivalry which prompted him, hearing the bell and knowing its
      meaning, to hastily summon his servants, and with five or six armed <i>peons</i>
      hasten out to overtake me and bid me return to his house until all danger
      was over. He had met the convicts, who had attacked him and struck him
      down, while most of his servants fled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunton paused, made and lighted another cigarette, and continued: &ldquo;I could
      not get away for a month, for it was not safe for a small party to leave
      the town. I brought out some of that tobacco as a curiosity and learned to
      like it. I send for more every year where it is still prepared, in the
      prison-pens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sometimes said, 'Follow your nose and it will take you out of
      danger,' and in my case the proverb proved true. Sometimes, when I sit
      here alone, half sleepily watching the curling smoke wreaths, I can almost
      see the place again, and the rings of smoke shape themselves into a horde
      of convict demons killing the poor old noble senor, whose elder daughter I
      have married. And now you know what I owe to the pungent aroma of a
      cigarette from Carcinto.&rdquo;

    <p>
      ATE one night, after having been a week out of town, I was returning home
      by a short cut across fields, when, on coming upon the street again, I
      found my path barred by a huge, hulking fellow, whose unexpected
      appearance startled me not a little. This was my introduction to Antaeus,
      whose better acquaintance I was to make later under rather peculiar
      circumstances. Antaeus was not a highway robber, but a highway roller, and
      when he first confronted me he was drawn up beside the road, enjoying an
      elephantine slumber after his hard day's labor&mdash;being, despite his
      formidable aspect, quiescent and inoffensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure that it is usual to confer upon steam-rollers the dignity of
      a name, but my friend had one, and I read it on the neat, black-lettered
      brass plate affixed to the side of his boiler, near the smoke-stack. This,
      I take it, was the nearest practicable approach to hanging a locket about
      his neck that could be managed, and I have always felt grateful to his
      unknown sponsors for their little act of consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot think of Antaeus otherwise than as a creature&mdash;not simply as
      a creation&mdash;as a reasoning and responsible being, rather than as a
      docile, slavish piece of mechanism; but to the unimaginative he seemed to
      be under the domination of a tolerably clean specimen of humanity whom I
      shall call the Driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly a fortnight after our first meeting when I next saw Antaeus,
      for he was occupied in parts of the town remote from that in which I
      lived. I heard him occasionally, however, as he passed through the
      neighborhood after dark, <i>en route</i> for another field of labor, or
      propelling his weary weight toward the shed under which he was lodged for
      his Sunday's rest. On such occasions, when I heard him lumbering by, I
      used to fancy he was taking an after-supper promenade and puffing a
      meditative cigar as he went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after he had come several times for pleasure, or his own
      convenience, he made us a professional call and buckled down to work at
      repairing a strip of street which had long stood in need! of his services.
      Antaeus was with us for several weeks and during his stay I became, in a
      measure, &ldquo;chummy&rdquo; with the Driver, from whom I learned various interesting
      facts about my muscular friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antaeus was a &ldquo;fifteen-tonner,&rdquo; and his market price was $4,000; he was
      about sixteen feet long by seven wide at his widest part; he consumed from
      three to four hundred pounds of coal per diem; his strength was equal to
      that of more horses than I can recollect; he came down upon the dust at
      the rate of two tons weight per foot in width; and, when put to his best,
      he could settle into what was intended to be its final resting place about
      two thousand square yards of new road material per day of ten hours. As
      regarded wheels he was tricycular, that is, he rested upon one roller in
      front and two behind, the former being also used for steering purposes. He
      had two small coal-bunkers in the rear, a reasonably commodious space,
      with a spring seat, for the Driver, and a good-sized awning overhead. He
      worked under a low pressure of I forget just how many pounds of steam, and
      when traveling for pleasure could do rather more miles a day than could a
      crack trotter per hour when put to his best paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      These particulars I learned during the first week that Antaeus was busied
      in our neighborhood. It was thus that I took the preliminary steps toward
      making his acquaintance and came to be on pleasant speaking terms with
      him, as it were. For the subsequent intimacy between Antaeus and myself,
      neither he nor I were wholly responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young lady had appeared at the house across the way. She was pretty, but
      I noticed her more particularly on account of the seemingly boundless
      capabilities of her wardrobe. She had a fresh gown for every new day, or
      at least, in the course of the first fortnight she had displayed a series
      of fourteen charming costumes, which I could no more hope to describe than
      could a North Greenland Eskimo to write an intelligent treatise on the
      flora of the torrid zone. I sat at my window, not too near, every morning
      when she came out of doors, and admired her through a spy-glass. This may
      appear like a piece of impertinence&mdash;perhaps it was&mdash;but I shall
      urge in my defence the fact that the street between us was nearly a
      hundred feet wide, and our two houses were set so far back that even by
      using my comparatively short-sighted little telescope, I could not bring
      her much nearer than we might actually have been without its aid in a more
      crowded neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon I stood talking with the Driver, while Antaeus was awaiting
      the deposit of more material by two tip-carts which were attached to his
      service, when she passed on the sidewalk, and I imagined she glanced at me
      with a certain degree of interest, as if she recalled having seen me
      before&mdash;or was it Antaeus who was the more worthy object of' her
      attention? Had I dared I should have smiled a little&mdash;merely a vague,
      sketchy, tentative smile&mdash;but, hardly thinking it prudent, I resisted
      the temptation and tried, as the photographers put it, to look natural;
      with the probable result of looking only cross. After having been her
      neighbor for more than two weeks it seemed as if I ought to have the right
      to speak, but proper consideration for <i>les convenances</i> forbade. It
      was vacation season, I was alone in the house, and, there being no
      womankind to make the necessary advances, I knew not how long it might be
      ere I could be formally introduced.

    <p>
      While I was meditating upon this state of affairs&mdash;peculiarly
      unfortunate for me&mdash;she walked on and disappeared around a corner. A
      few minutes later the fire-alarm bell sounded the number of a box near by,
      and presently our beautiful fire-engine, all glittering with gold and
      silver plate, the just pride of the town, dashed rather noisily by. At
      sight of this brilliant appearance Antaeus gave vent to a species of snort
      and started up as if to follow, but naturally his lumbering pace was no
      match for the swiftness of the other machine, and from the first he was
      left hopelessly in the rear. I went off to see where the fire was&mdash;it
      proved to be of small account&mdash;and forgot Antaeus entirely until that
      night, when he recalled himself to my mind by figuring in an odd and
      whimsical dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene I have just described was reproduced in part, the Driver,
      however, being eliminated from it. I thought I was standing beside Antaeus
      when the young lady appeared, only to disappear. As she went I sighed
      regretfully, whereupon something happened which ought to have surprised
      me, and would have done so anywhere else than in a dream. As if in
      sympathy with me, Antaeus heaved a sigh also&mdash;a most ponderous one&mdash;and
      thus addressed me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand your feelings,&rdquo; he said, in a low, hoarse voice. &ldquo;You
      are longing for what seems the unattainable. Alas! so am I. We might
      mingle our tears,&rdquo; he went on, beginning to exude moisture around the
      gauges; &ldquo;or better still,&rdquo; he added, as if struck by an idea, &ldquo;perhaps we
      can be of assistance to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; I asked, dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might help you to know <i>her</i> if you would help me to an
      acquaintance with the charming Electra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Intuitively I divined that Electra must be the steam fire-engine. Big,
      brawny Antaeus was in love! The ludicrousness of the notion did not strike
      me then as it did afterward. On the contrary, it seemed to be one of the
      most natural things imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in response to my thoughts, &ldquo;I am passionately enamored of
      her. I desire unutterably to gain her friendship, her esteem, her love&mdash;even
      though she may scorn me. I realize that her station in life is far above
      mine. I am only a plodder, while she is&mdash;Did you see her pass me like
      a flash of light this afternoon? Was she not entrancing, enthralling,
      irresistible! Ah, me! when she bestows her love it will be upon one of
      those fast, dashing railway fellows, I dare say. Yet I should like her to
      know that I am her friend, that I would risk any danger, that I would go
      through the torments of&mdash;of the repair shop, that I would give my
      last puff to serve her. I may be ugly and slow-going, and awkward and
      ungainly&mdash;Do you think I am so very ungainly, that is, for one in my
      walk of life?&rdquo; he broke off, in rather piteous query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I hastened to assure him; &ldquo;when we consider your great
      adaptability to your&mdash;your vocation, I am sure your form would be
      considered remarkably symmetrical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, gratefully, &ldquo;and whether or not such be the
      case, at least I am honest and straightforward and true-hearted, though I
      do blow my own whistle in saying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I trust I am not too aspiring in wishing to be numbered among
      Electra's friends. I hope she would not be ashamed to acknowledge me if
      she met me in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope not, indeed,&rdquo; I murmured, when he paused for an encouraging
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we call it a bargain, then, that I aid you to an introduction to
      the young lady, your neighbor, and in return you so contrive as to bring
      about a meeting between Electra and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bargain it is, with all my heart,&rdquo; I assented, grasping and shaking the
      handle of his throttle-lever, &ldquo;and the sooner the better for the carrying
      out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; call on me to-morrow, and I will see what can be done for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall&mdash;shall I come in business hours?&rdquo; I asked, hesitatingly,
      thinking he might possibly prefer to attend to the matter between twelve
      and one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;in business hours, certainly. I mean business,
      and I hope you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to set his mind at rest on that point, and, after promising to
      come on the following afternoon, I shook his handle again, which had the
      effect of starting him off, and so our interview ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke in the morning, my dream seemed so vividly real that I
      resolved to risk making myself ridiculous in my own eyes and to keep my
      appointment with Antaeus. Accordingly, after lunch, I strolled out toward
      the section of highway where he was at work. Soon I caught sight of a
      light-complexioned wagon standing on the opposite side of the street.
      Attached to it were two plump, blonde ponies, garbed in russet harness,
      and, on the front seat, reins in hand, talking with an acquaintance upon
      the sidewalk, sat my young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natty vehicle had one other occupant, a sooty-faced pug, sitting up
      very straight on the cushion beside his mistress, with quite the air of a
      personage of distinction. In front of the ponies' noses was a horse of
      another breed, a four-legged structure of wood, upholding a sign-board,
      upon which was painted in glaring letters the word, &ldquo;Danger,&rdquo; and in
      smaller ones, &ldquo;No Passing; Steam Roller Running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this scene presently entered an important actor&mdash;I might call
      him the heavy villian&mdash;Antaeus, grumbling, groaning, puffing and
      perspiring in his efforts to consolidate the various ingredients for a
      durable roadbed that had been laid down in his path. As he drew nearer he
      gave utterance to a significant &ldquo;ahem!&rdquo;&mdash;as I thought&mdash;by way of
      calling my attention to what was about to happen. Apparently he was going
      to keep his part of our agreement. A suspicion of what might be his idea
      began to dawn upon me. He purposed frightening the ponies, an incipient
      runaway would ensue, and I should be enabled to play the part of heroic
      rescuer. There were no very original features in the scheme, but it struck
      me as being quite practicable nevertheless; consequently I was somewhat
      surprised and grieved when nothing of the nature of what I had anticipated
      took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Antaeus was more subtle than I. He wished to avoid the appearance of
      collusion between us, which might have been given by the execution of the
      rudimentary strategem I have outlined. (Or perhaps the real explanation of
      it is that he knew the fat little beasts of ponies were of too phlegmatic
      a temperament to be disturbed by a bugaboo.) At any rate they only blinked
      sleepily at Antaeus and then went off into a peaceful doze, entirely
      unmoved by his nearness. With the black-vis-aged pug, however, it was
      quite otherwise. He regarded the monster as an interloper, a trespasser,
      and he began to bark at him angrily. Perceiving that his scoldings had no
      effect, he lost his temper entirely, and, jumping down from the carriage
      seat, ran forward toward the advancing engine and continued his barking
      with redoubled force and fury. His mistress' attention was now aroused,
      and, seeing how persistently he put himself in the track of the roller,
      she became uneasy. She called to him persuasively, authoritatively,
      beseechingly, but he paid her no heed. Apparently he had more faith in
      himself than had King Canute when he gave his memorable lesson to his
      courtiers by the seashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his position in the rear the Driver could not see the dog, and I
      doubt if he clearly understood the situation, for he made no attempt to
      avert the threatened catastrophe. The ridiculous animal stood his ground
      and kept up his remonstrances against the invader; the alarmed young lady
      threw an eloquently imploring look at me; and Antaeus came on, stolid,
      grim and impassive. Meanwhile, strangely enough&mdash;as it seems to me
      now&mdash;I remained inactive until my coadjutor, justly irritated,
      suddenly growled out what I took to mean:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come; stupid, now is your time; why don't you bestir yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I awakened to a full sense of my responsibilities and opportunities,
      and rushing to the fore, seized the rash and obstinate pug by the scruff
      of the neck and restored him, rescued from the Juggernaut, to the arms of
      his grateful mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did Antaeus fulfill his share of our agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little incident broke the ice. In less than a week the young lady and
      I knew each other almost intimately. It transpired that we were in fact
      old acquaintances. That is to say, she remembered me when I was at home
      during one college vacation, and she hoped I had not forgotten the small
      miss who used to come over and play tea-party with my sister. I replied
      that I should hope not, indeed, and mentally took myself to task for not
      being surer about it. The boy of seventeen is less likely to be impressed
      with the girl of eight than is the young man of twenty-eight with the
      maiden of nineteen. I was positive that at the end of another eleven years
      I should have had no trouble in recalling her to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not a tennis enthusiast, but I will admit that my white flannel suit
      had a chance to contrast itself with the velvety green of the lawn across
      the way rather frequently after that. It was a convenient and plausible
      excuse for being with her a good deal.

      The pleasure of her society was worth some physical discomfort, and I
      couldn't complain if I did feel for a week or more as if I had been given
      a sound drubbing. One day, after we had finished a series of games&mdash;in
      which mine was second-best record&mdash;who should appear, laboriously
      rumbling by, but my well-nigh forgotten friend Antaeus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an uncouth piece of mechanism that is!&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning to
      look at him&mdash;&ldquo;a sort of caricature of a locomotive, one might say. A
      veritable snail for traveling, too, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; his&mdash;I mean it's&mdash;best speed does not exceed five miles an
      hour, I am told. A man might walk as fast as that with a little exertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it is a pleasant mode of riding&mdash;in a steam-roller?&rdquo; she
      said, half musing, her gaze still resting on Antaeus. &ldquo;At least one would
      have plenty of leisure for viewing the scenery along the way. I should
      rather like to try a short ride on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you, really,&rdquo; I asked, doubting whether or not she was in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, I should.&rdquo; If she had been half in jest before she was
      serious now. &ldquo;It would be a new experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly an agreeable one for a lady, though,&rdquo; I commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be a secondary consideration,&rdquo; she returned with a shrug.
      &ldquo;I should value the experience as an experience, and I should be glad to
      have it to put on my list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked inquisitive and she proceeded to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep a diary&mdash;not a regulation school girl's diary, in which one
      feels bound to write something every single day of the year, whether there
      is anything worth recording or not&mdash;but a collection of memoranda in
      which I take a good deal of satisfaction. Mine is a classified diary and
      is contained in about a dozen different books which began as mere covers
      with nothing between. By putting in leaves when there was occasion the
      volumes grew until now several of them have attained to a very respectable
      thickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I ask, without indiscretion, for a hint as to the nature of their
      contents, or would that be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; there is no secret about them. In fact I have been known to
      show their pages to certain of my friends, and, to be quite honest, I am
      rather proud of them. As far as I can recollect now, they are labeled with
      these titles: 'Books I have read, Places I have visited, Notable
      personages I have seen, Odd or eccentric characters I have met, Strange
      sights I have seen, Curious dishes of which I have eaten, Rides I have
      taken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;that every time you take a ride you enter an
      account of it in your collection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that whenever I ride in or on any unusual sort of conveyance I
      make a note of it. That particular book dates far back into my childhood.
      The idea of starting it was suggested to me by a ride I took on a tame
      ostrich in South Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My increased respect for a young lady who had ridden upon an ostrich near,
      if not actually in his native desert, will be understood by the
      untraveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen something of the world,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;I have been about with my father a great deal. An
      uncle of mine, who abhors what he calls globe-trotting, tells people, with
      a look of mock commiseration on his face, that I have been everywhere
      except at the North Pole and in a Trappist monastery. A slight
      exaggeration that, and yet not so very far from the truth either. I have
      visited most of the inhabited countries of the globe, I think, and I have
      had a chance to try riding in a good many peculiar conveyances. I have
      ridden on an elephant in India, on a dromedary in Egypt, in a sort of
      horse-litter in Persia, in a man-carriage in Japan, in a sledge on bare
      ground at Funchal, on a log-raft down the Rhine, on an Indian's back in
      Mexico, in the cab of a locomotive on the Southern Pacific, in a fast
      newspaper train out of New York, on an open car moved by gravity&mdash;and
      moved very fast, too&mdash;on that wonderful railroad in Peru, on a small
      landslide among the White Mountains, in a dwelling-house being moved
      through the streets of this town, in&mdash;&mdash; but I will spare you
      further enumeration.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, however, that you will let me read the catalogue for myself some
      time. I no longer wonder that so successful a collector should be eager
      for an additional specimen. I happen to have some little acquaintance with
      the man who runs our steam-roller; perhaps I could arrange to have your
      wish for a ride gratified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you <i>only</i> could!&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking so hopefully
      expectant that I secretly vowed the thing should come to pass or I would
      know the most unanswerable of reasons why.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had learned that Antaeus was neither a native nor a naturalized citizen
      of our town, but that he owed allegiance to a firm of contractors in a
      distant city, whose delegate and sole representative here was the Driver;
      consequently if I could prevail upon him to lend Antaeus I need apprehend
      no interference from the town authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began upon the Driver the next forenoon. My persuasiveness took a
      conventional form, for, not being gifted with an oily tongue, I was forced
      to trust for success in a great measure upon my chance of stupefying the
      Driver's conscience with the fumes of several superfine cigars. I spent
      about two hours in company with Antaeus, taking many turns up and down the
      street with him for the special purpose of observing his manners and
      customs. With the advice and consent of his guardian I learned to start,
      to stop, to reverse, and to steer to my own satisfaction. I had intended
      to broach the important question that day, but, fearing I might not yet
      have sufficiently blunted the Driver's moral sensibilities, my courage
      failed at the critical moment and I permitted myself the expensive luxury
      of procrastination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I found the task no easier, and so put it off again, but on
      the day after I awakened to the fact that delays are dangerous and made
      the fateful plunge. I frankly told the Driver the whole story, under the
      belief that he would be less likely to refuse the petition of a lady than
      one made in my own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had suspected all the while, from my persistent attentions, that I
      had an axe to grind he did not mortify me by showing it. He accepted my
      fifth cigar as he had my first, with an air of supposing it to be offered
      from motives of the most disinterested friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not meet with success in the outset. The Driver had grave doubts as
      to the propriety of &ldquo;loaning&rdquo; a steam-roller. Had he been a Frenchman he
      might reasonably have urged that, like a tooth-brush, <i>ça ne se prête
      pas</i>. However, I overcame his scruples in the end, and, probably in the
      belief that &ldquo;if it were done 'twere well it were done quickly,&rdquo; he agreed
      to deliver Antaeus into my charge that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, not long after sunset, I went across the street and called
      for the young lady. I realized fully that her father and mother would not
      have approved of our escapade, but they were absent from home and I tried
      to believe it was not my duty to stand toward her <i>in loco parentium</i>.
      She was a bit wilful too, and I feared my remonstrances would do no good
      unless I carried them to the extreme of refusing my assistance, which,
      after my ready offer of it, would have been uncivil and unkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an unfrequented spot, on a broad highway, near the outskirts of the
      town, Antaeus and the Driver&mdash;the former under head of steam, and
      both smoking&mdash;were awaiting us. We met them there by appointment at
      nine o'clock. After many instructions and cautions touching the fire, the
      water, the steam, the use of the levers, the necessity of keeping a sharp
      lookout ahead, etc., the Driver left me in sole command, as proud as a boy
      with his first bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find you have got into rather close quarters here, don't you?&rdquo; said
      I, as I perched myself upon the high seat, from which the machine was most
      conveniently directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The passenger accommodations might be more spacious, but all things
      considered I hardly think I shall complain,&rdquo; laughingly returned my
      companion, who had seated herself on one of the coal-boxes behind me. &ldquo;I
      took the precaution not to wear my best frock, so I can stow myself away
      in small compass without fear of damage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having in mind the trouble I had taken, her delight in the novelty of her
      situation was highly gratifying to me. She eagerly asked about the
      functions of the various levers, try-cocks, and gauges, and insisted upon
      being allowed to experiment with them, as well as with the steering gear,
      herself. The knowledge, she said, might be useful to her in the future.
      Antaeus proved to be entirely docile and allowed himself to be guided as
      easily as a well-broken flesh and blood horse. The big fly-wheel revolved,
      the fussy little piston pumped up and down with an ado that seemed absurd
      considering the slow progress resulting, the steam fretted and hissed, the
      three massive rollers bore with all their might upon the hard surface of
      the macadam, and thus crunching, clanking, thumping and rattling, we
      sluggishly made our way into the obscurity of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, in the course of our journey, we came to a gentle rise, the
      ascent of which made Antaeus puff rather laboriously. For a moment my
      passenger looked slightly uneasy. &ldquo;Why does it do that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The exertion of going up hill makes him breathe a little hard,
      naturally,&rdquo; I answered, reassuring her. &ldquo;He is feeling in fine condition,
      though,&rdquo; I added, inspecting the steam-gauge by the light of my lantern;
      &ldquo;the effect of a plentiful supply of oats, doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of <i>it</i> as <i>he</i>,&rdquo; she said, questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; why not?&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;He seems to me unequivocally
      masculine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; she assented; &ldquo;still in personifying inanimate objects, are they
      not more frequently made members of the other sex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly they are, but it strikes me as a ridiculous custom&mdash;particularly
      in the case of great machines. No engine, however big, black or ungainly,
      but it must be spoken of by the feminine pronoun. It is hardly a
      compliment to your sex, is it? Think of the incongruity of putting, for
      instance, a huge steamboat, named for the president of the company, into
      the feminine gender!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at my fancy, but her merriment did not wound my sensibilities.
      &ldquo;So it's&mdash;I beg pardon, <i>his</i>&mdash;name is Antaeus, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in honor of that old giant&mdash;do you recollect?&mdash;whom
      Hercules overcame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By lifting him quite off the ground, because as often as he came in
      contact with Mother Earth his strength was renewed? Yes, I recall the
      story, and I can see a certain propriety in the name. I rather think this
      fellow, if he were to be lifted off the ground, could scarcely use his
      great strength to advantage. Imagine him turned upon his back like a huge
      beetle, kicking about frantically into the air to no purpose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly he gets his grip from his contact with the earth,&rdquo; said I.
      &ldquo;As a flying-machine he would hardly be a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't it strike you that he is almost unnecessarily deliberate?&rdquo; she
      queried, presently, with a slight show of impatience; evidently the
      novelty of the adventure was beginning to wear off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More so than usual for the reason that we are ascending an incline; but
      you must remember that Antaeus was not built for speed,&rdquo; returned I,
      defending my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently not. He belongs to the plodders&mdash;the slow and sure sort.
      He would be entered for a race in the tortoise class probably. Fancy an
      absconding cashier trying to escape from justice in a steam-roller! It
      would be funny, wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with her that it would be very funny. &ldquo;Or imagine an eloping
      couple fleeing before an irate father on such a conveyance!&rdquo; I suggested,
      with a consciousness of blushing in the dark for the audacity of the
      conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that is good!&rdquo; she exclaimed, seizing on my idea with an eagerness
      that showed how far her thoughts were from taking the direction in which
      mine had dared to stray. &ldquo;What a situation for a modern realistic,
      sensational drama!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be worked up into something rather impressive, I should think.
      In these days of bringing steamboats, pile-drivers, fire-engines, real
      water, and railway trains in upon the stage I don't know why a
      steam-roller might not be given a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she cried, waxing enthusiastic. &ldquo;Picture the scene. Enter
      lovers on 'steam-roller, followed by incensed father in&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an electric-car,&rdquo; I supplied experimentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! don't be foolish!&rdquo; she exclaimed thanklessly. &ldquo;Followed by father
      in a light gig, drawn by a spirited horse. Overtakes lovers&mdash;demands
      his daughter&mdash;young man respectfully declines to give her up. Old
      gentleman prepares to come and take her. Is about to descend from gig when
      steamroller whistles, spirited horse begins to prance, he is obliged to
      keep tight hold of reins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; I put in approvingly. &ldquo;Stern parent threatens direst
      vengeance, horse cavorts alarmingly, parent rages unavailingly, resolute
      lover pushes throttle wide open with one hand and retains firm grip upon
      the helm with the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While the devoted loveress, with her own dainty hands, shovels in coal
      and encourages him to stand firm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, that reminds me of something,&rdquo; I interrupted and, getting off
      my elevated seat, I bent down and opened the furnace-door; &ldquo;I rather think
      I should have given Antaeus his supper before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, I had neglected the fire altogether too long. I hastily threw in
      more coal, but it was already too late to avert the consequences of my
      forgetfulness. The pressure of steam was diminishing and continued to
      diminish in spite of all my efforts to prevent it. Back fell the indicator
      upon the dial, and more and more slowly worked the machinery as the power
      behind it became less and less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not reach the top of the hill at the present rate,&rdquo; remarked my
      companion. &ldquo;The vital spark appears to be in danger of extinction, so to
      speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In very great danger,&rdquo; I sorrowfully assented as, with one last feeble
      effort, Antaeus wearily gave up the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor is that the worst of it,&rdquo; I added, filled with a sudden apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, disquieted by my manner, though not yet
      divining the inevitable outcome of the existing state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better descend to <i>terra firma</i> unless you want to go back
      down hill faster than you came up,&rdquo; I replied significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, comprehending the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the attraction of gravitation is going to take us back a deal faster
      than Antaeus ever traveled before. Shall I help you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you put on the brakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are none; the builders of this machine did not foresee such a
      contingency as this. It was not to be supposed that Antaeus ever would
      fall into the unskillful hands of a bungling, blundering amateur,&rdquo; said I,
      calling up hard names for myself from out of the depths of my humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't reproach yourself,&rdquo; she begged; &ldquo;it is I who am to be blamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I not help you out before it is too late?&rdquo; I interposed, as Antaeus
      began to gather way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do,&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall stick to the ship,&rdquo; I answered grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will get hurt if you do,&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antaeus will get hurt if I don't. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall stay on board, too,&rdquo; she declared heroically. &ldquo;Now don't try
      and persuade me to desert, for I shall not do it. Can't I be of some use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that she was firm in her resolve to stand by me, I gratefully
      accepted her offer of assistance, which indeed, was of considerable value.
      It was important that I should keep a firm hold upon the steering wheel,
      to prevent the craft from yawing, and, unless I were to be continually
      screwing my head about in a very painful position, I could not very well
      see the road over which we were traveling. From a position between the
      coal-boxes behind me&mdash;now the front of the conveyance&mdash;she could
      keep a look-out and pass the word to me when it became necessary to
      correct the deviations in our course. Without her help, it is more than
      probable that I should have run Antaeus ignominiottsly, perhaps
      disastrously, into a ditch before reaching the foot of the incline. Even
      as it was, I had my hands full.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ride, which certainly was one of the most disquieting, mentally
      and physically, that I ever have taken, we said very little to each other.
      I gripped the wheel, and she grasped the iron sides of the coal-bunkers,
      between which she stood, opening her lips only to call, &ldquo;right! left!&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;steady!&rdquo; as I had hastily instructed her to do for my guidance in
      steering. So we rumbled and rattled and jolted on down the hill, at
      continually increasing speed, until at length we reached the base, and I
      drew a deep breath of relief at knowing that the worst was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived upon a level, our momentum gradually expended itself. From an
      estimated ten-mile rate&mdash;which had seemed terrific&mdash;we slowed to
      a five, to a three, to a one, to a snail's pace, and then something
      occurred which, although not threatening any danger to us personally,
      filled our minds with the liveliest anxiety for the safety of others.
      Antaeus came to a stand-still just across the railway track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said my passenger, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I returned, blankly, as I pulled my watch from my pocket, &ldquo;this is&mdash;interesting,
      to say the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there&mdash;how about trains?&rdquo; she queried anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the jolting of our forced&mdash;and forcible&mdash;descent our
      lantern had gone out; but there was an electric lamp near, and by its
      light I managed to read the hour upon my watch-dial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a train leaving the city at ten, due here at ten-seventeen; it
      now lacks five minutes of that. I must go to the station and report that
      the way is blocked. I am sorry to leave you&mdash;or would you prefer
      going while I wait here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will be better for you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; I'll not be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0042" id="linkimage-0042"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      This promise of mine was ill-advised. I hurried up the track to the
      station, only to find it locked and deserted. It was not the principal
      station of the town, being one of the half-dozen smaller ones strung at
      short intervals along the line. In all probability it would not be opened
      until a few minutes before train-time. As I knew the outcoming train would
      stop at that station, and thus give me a chance to warn the engineer of
      the obstruction ahead, I did not feel particularly alarmed at not finding
      the agent at once. Still I was conscious of some nervous uneasiness while
      awaiting his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came leisurely across the street, jingling his keys as he
      walked. As soon as he stepped foot upon the platform I went to 'him and
      began to tell my story. I had not proceeded far with it ere he interrupted
      me with a startled ejaculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott! The White Mountain express!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What do you mean?&rdquo; I gasped,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New train&mdash;put on yesterday&mdash;passes here on the way in at
      ten-ten, and it's more than that now!&rdquo; he exclaimed in staccato, as he
      hastily unlocked the station door, and, putting in his hand, seized a red
      lantern that had been sitting ready lighted on the floor within.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not waste any more time with me, but rushed along to the end of the
      platform, and then began to run with all his might down the track. I
      succeeded in following him at not too great a distance, although I was
      turning sick and giddy with all sorts of horrible apprehensions. Visions
      of a frightful wreck photographed themselves on my brain, the shrieks of
      the dying sounded prophetically in my ears, and in the midst of it all I
      was selfishly deploring the fact that I should be called on to pay the
      damages&mdash;at least to Antaeus&mdash;and wondering if I could contrive
      to get a hardware discount off the market price of steam-rollers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crossing was still hidden from us around a curve when a shrill
      whistling broke upon my startled ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-o-o-t!&mdash;t-o-o-t! Toot! toot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent uttered an explosive invocation to the Deity, and added in tones
      of despair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're too late; she's onto us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still we staggered mechanically forward, until suddenly, with a cry of
      warning, the agent sprang aside, and the express went thundering by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, young man,&rdquo; my companion exclaimed angrily, &ldquo;if this is a
      put-up job&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not!&rdquo; I interposed with indignant protest. &ldquo;I don't understand
      it any better than you do. Certainly I left Ant&mdash;the roller sprawled
      across both tracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess it ain't there now,&rdquo; dryly remarked the agent, watching the
      rear lights of the fast-receding train, until they were swallowed up in
      the glare of the &ldquo;local's&rdquo; head-light. &ldquo;I must run back,&rdquo; he added,
      recalled to a sense of his duties. &ldquo;You take this lantern and go and see
      if the outward track is clear. Stand between the rails and swing the
      lantern if it ain't. I'll tell the engineer to go slow and be on the
      lookout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute I was at the crossing. I looked up and down the street
      for Antaeus, but neither he nor the young lady were to be seen. If that
      Hercules of a locomotive actually had lifted him into the air and carried
      him off his absence could not have been more conspicuous. But naturally
      such a feat>could not have been accomplished, nor had it been attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real explanation of the mysterious disappearance was this. During my
      absence the fire under the boiler had been getting up, until finally
      enough steam had made to start the machinery and so the roller had been
      enabled to roll itself away out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to start toward town, under the supposition that Antaeus had
      taken that direction, when I chanced to recollect that with the levers as
      I had left them he naturally must go just the opposite way&mdash;that is,
      retrace the course over which he had lately come. Accordingly I set out on
      the run toward the hill. Near the foot of it I found him, diagonaled off
      the road-side with his nose against a tree, loudly hissing in impotent
      rage at the unwelcome bar to his progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped into the engineer's place, reversed the machinery, and without
      very much trouble succeeded in getting him back into the road and started
      on the homeward way. I was putting to myself an uneasy question as to the
      whereabouts of my passenger, when, to my relief, I heard her voice close
      at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo; she inquired anxiously; &ldquo;I feared it was going to blow
      up or something, it made such a horribly distressing noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That very noise was a guarantee that he was <i>not</i> going to blow up,&rdquo;
       I replied, bringing Antaeus to a stop. &ldquo;He was merely getting rid of
      superfluous steam through the safety-.valve. I am very glad to find you
      again. Will you ride? I think we shall get on smoothly this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather hesitatingly she allowed me to help her in. Then, after taking the
      precaution to add some fuel to the fire, and to inspect the steam and
      water indicators by the light of my borrowed red lantern, I opened the
      throttle and started on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the train frighten you?&rdquo; I bethought myself to ask, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't speak of it,&rdquo; she returned with a shudder; &ldquo;I heard it coming
      from two or three miles away, and when it got nearer and nearer and you
      did not return I was almost frantic. But I couldn't do anything. I don't
      think it was more than a quarter of a mile distant, with the light
      gleaming along the rails and making it seem even nearer, when the roller
      began to move&mdash;but, oh, how slowly! I thought I should&mdash;well, if
      my hair hasn't turned gray from that scare it never will do so until the
      natural time for it comes, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the old fellow got off in time, evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but with hardly a second to spare. He hadn't cleared the rails of
      the other track when the train passed. It was a frightfully narrow
      margin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not on board all this while, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; that would have been too foolhardy. But when I saw it was making
      off I didn't want it&mdash;I mean <i>him</i>&mdash;to go careering and
      cavorting about the country alone, so I climbed up and tried to take
      command. You showed me how to use the reversing-lever, and it all seemed
      easy when you were here, but when I was alone I didn't dare touch it for
      fear something disastrous would happen. All I ventured to do was to take
      the wheel and keep, him in the road&mdash;or rather try to do so, for I
      didn't succeed very well. My strength was not equal to it. He swerved a
      little and then got to going more and more on the bias, until at last,
      despite all I could do to the contrary, he ran off against a tree and was
      obliged to stop. Soon afterward that hissing noise began, and, fearing an
      explosion, I ran and got behind the wall on the other side of the street,
      and then&mdash;then you came. I don't think I ever was more rejoiced to
      see anybody in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I resisted a temptation to make a speech, which, however much in earnest I
      was, might have sounded silly, and contented myself with remarking that I
      was glad to have arrived in such good time, and I turned my attention to
      the taking of her&mdash;and Antaeus&mdash;safe home.

    <p>
      I could not get to sleep after going to bed that night. The evening's
      experience of itself was hardly a soporific, but there was yet another
      matter to occupy my thoughts and prevent my sleeping. Should I venture at
      the next favorable opportunity to put a certain question to a certain
      person? If I did so what answer should I receive? I hoped and I feared and
      I doubted concerning the sentiments of the said certain person toward my
      unworthy self. I revolved the thing in my mind until there seemed to be
      little else there but revolution. Progress in any direction, certainly
      there was none. My body was hardly less restless than my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o'clock it flashed across me like a revelation, that I was
      hungry. I had eaten a light supper hours ago, and now my stomach was
      eloquent with emptiness; while the blood which should be doing good
      service there was pulsing madly about in my brain to no purpose. I went
      down stairs and inspected the contents of the ice-chest. Roast pork and
      brown bread make rather a hearty late supper, but breakfast time was so
      near I thought I would risk them&mdash;and a good deal of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to my room, I set a lamp upon a stand at the head of the bed
      and, taking the first book that came to hand&mdash;it chanced to be an
      Italian grammar&mdash;I began to read. I had gone as far in the
      introduction as &ldquo;CC like t-ch in hatchet,&rdquo; when I grew drowsy. I laid down
      the book, my eyelids drooped, and there is good circumstantial evidence
      that a moment later I fell asleep, lying on my back with the upper half of
      my body bent into the form of a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      My slumbers were visited by a dream&mdash;a nightmare, composed, I
      estimate, of cold roast pork and brown bread, uncomfortable bodily
      position, the memory of certain occurrences in my past history, and an
      event to be described later. In this dream Antaeus figured largely. He
      seemed to come rolling across the bed, and me, until he had stopped upon
      my chest and stomach.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I asked in alarm. &ldquo;Do you know you are crushing me?
      Get away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I am. I <i>weigh</i> fifteen tons,&rdquo; Antaeus replied, heavily
      jocose. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he continued with a burst of anger, &ldquo;you are an
      honorable, high-minded sort of person, you are. What do you mean by
      treating me so? Have you forgotten our compact? I have given you every
      chance man could ask for with <i>her</i>; what have you done for me in
      return? Nothing. Even worse than nothing. To faithlessness you have added
      treachery. Not content with deceiving me, you have sought to destroy me. I
      suppose you hoped to see my <i>débris</i> strewn along the iron way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was conscience-stricken by his accusations; but I could refute a part of
      them. &ldquo;Oh, no! oh, no!&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;it was an accident, I assure you. So
      far from desiring such a thing, I declare that I cannot even imagine your
      being reduced to <i>débris</i>. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; roared Antaeus, and in his rage he began to belch forth smoke&mdash;smoke
      so thick and black that I thought I should be stifled by it. In another
      moment I awoke gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      One feature of my dream was a reality&mdash;the smoke. The room was filled
      with it, and there were flames beside. As nearly as I can guess, the
      situation on which I opened my eyes had been thus brought about. While I
      slept the wind had risen and, pushing inward the shade at the open window,
      had pressed it against the small, unstable stand until the latter had been
      tipped over, bringing the lighted lamp to the floor. The muslin curtains
      had caught fire; from them the straw matting, kerosene-soaked, had flamed
      up, so that now a pretty lively blaze was in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang off the bed, made a snatch at some of my clothes, and got out of
      the room as soon as possible. After I had helped save everything portable,
      that could be saved without risk to life, I went and stood before the
      house in the cool air of the early dawn and watched the struggle between
      flames and flood. In the midst of my perturbation I noticed something that
      struck me as being worthy of remark. I had left Antaeus at the edge of the
      roadway before our gate; now the fire-engine, Electra, had been drawn up
      beside him. He was maintaining strict silence, but I hoped he was being
      well entertained, for Electra kept up an incessant buzzing&mdash;woman
      like, quite willing to do all of the talking. At any rate my share of our
      compact was now fulfilled; Antaeus and I were quits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the later morning I saw the young lady. My misfortunes called forth
      from her expressions of sincerest pity; indeed, she bitterly reproached
      herself for having been the direct cause of them. When I described my
      narrow escape from death by suffocation, she grew so pale that I thought
      she must feel considerable interest in me, although I immediately
      reflected that it could not be very pleasant to have one's next-door
      neighbor roasted alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by I told her of my two dreams, and of the way in which I finally
      kept faith with Antaeus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shame that you had to burn up your house to do it,&rdquo; she
      commented, &ldquo;when a brush-heap might have answered the purpose quite as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought&mdash;or I hoped&mdash;that the time had come for making a
      decisive move with some chance of its being effective. I furtively
      possessed myself of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not regret the house so much,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I might hope you
      would deign to extend to me the favor with which Electra has made Antaeus
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was bunglingly put, but she understood me well enough, although she
      murmured in reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it already; we are&mdash;acquainted. Surely you don't want&mdash;anything&mdash;more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she did not withdraw her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just heard that the town fathers contemplate purchasing Antaeus and
      giving him a permanent residence &ldquo;within our borders.&rdquo; If this report be
      true, I shall use all my influence&mdash;from motives of gratitude&mdash;to
      have him lodged beside the engine-house, so that he may be near his
      bewitching Electra.

    <p>
      AVING completed his breakfast, Mr. Percy Darley seated himself in a n
      easy-chair, facing the cheerful grate-fire of ruddy anthracite, placed his
      toes upon the fender, and relapsed into a thoughtful contemplation of
      Leonard's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had best come, my dear boy,&rdquo; said the letter. &ldquo;It is a sleepy little
      town&mdash;one of those idyllic Acadian places of which you used to rave
      when you were tired of the city and fretful at her ways. We can smoke our
      pipes and chat over the old days, before a fire in my big, old-fashioned
      grate. There is a noble stretch of clear ice here now. Our little river is
      frozen over, solid and safe, and the darkest prospects do not foreshadow
      another fall of snow for a fortnight. The sleighing is superb; and, as
      Madeline Bridges says, 'the nights are splendid.' Pack up your traps and
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was an alluring one, thought Darley. His head ached, and
      his heart was sick of the everlasting round of parties and calls and
      suppers. What a vision of beatific rest that idea of a chat over old
      times! Ah, dear old times of childhood and youth, when our tears are as
      ephemeral as our spendthrift dimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be only one rational preclusion&mdash;to wit, Miss
      Charteris. Not that he thought Miss Charteris would personally object to
      his absence, but, rather, that <i>he</i> had an objection to leaving Miss
      Charteris. Miss Charteris was an heiress, and a handsome woman; to be
      brief, Miss Charteris being rich, and our friend Darley having the
      millstone of debt about his neck, he had determined, if possible, to wed
      her. If he went away, however, at this period of his acquaintance, when
      the heiress and he were becoming fast friends, some one else would
      doubtless step into the easy shoes of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Darley went down into the city and telegraphed his friend Leonard that
      he would be in Dutton on the evening train. He thought he should like to
      see Miss Charteris, however, before going. He walked back slowly along a
      particularly favorite drive of hers, and presently met this young lady
      with her stylish little turn-out, looking very radiant and happy on this
      bright winter morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some one with her&mdash;a fact Darley noticed with no great
      feeling of pleasure. It was not a strange thing; but, following the course
      of things as they had been for the past few weeks, it should have been
      Darley himself. This morning it was a sallow, dark young man whom Darley
      did not remember having seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley explained that he was about to leave town for a few weeks, as soon
      as Miss Charteris had drawn up alongside the pavement to wish him
      goodmorning. Then she introduced him to her companion. &ldquo;A very old friend&mdash;Mr.
      Severance&mdash;just arrived from Australia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Dutton!&rdquo; said Miss Charteris, looking reminiscent. &ldquo;You must not
      break any trusting hearts down there, Mr. Darley; for the Dutton maids are
      not only lovely, but proverbially trusting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Dutton, then?&rdquo; Darley answered, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I have a very dear aunt in Dutton&mdash;oh, but you will see! I
      spent some of my happiest days there. So did you, I think, Lawrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Severance reflectively, &ldquo;days almost as happy as the
      present day. Don't you think, Mr. Darley, that a man's best years cluster
      round the age of ten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley could not help agreeing to this. All men, provided their youth has
      been happy, think so. Darley said good-by, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was this fellow Severance? <i>She</i> called him Lawrence&mdash;<i>Lawrence</i>,
      by Jove! There was something in it&mdash;rather old schoolmates, too, they
      had been, and what might they not be now? It was more pique than
      disappointment which caused Darley to wish momentarily that he was not
      scheduled for Dutton. However, he must stand the hazard of the die.
    </p>
    <p>
      His things were soon packed; he also supplied himself with a box of the
      cigars Leonard and he used to love in &ldquo;the days that are no more,&rdquo; and a
      copy of &ldquo;Outing.&rdquo; And ten hours later the train, with a jovial roar, ran
      into the little town, where the lights gleamed cozily against the snowy
      background, and the sleigh-bells seemed to bid him a merry, musical
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short, erect, trimly built man with a finely chiseled face and a brown
      skin that seemed to breathe of pine woods and great wide, sunlit rivers
      grasped Darley's hand as he stepped to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man!&rdquo; exclaimed the brown man, cheerily. &ldquo;Awfully glad you've
      come! Come this way! Here we are, Joseph! Step in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! it <i>is</i> wintry here, isn't it?&rdquo; said Darley, as he slid
      under the buffalo robes. &ldquo;What a peerless night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After supper the two men made themselves thoroughly comfortable in great
      leather chairs before Leonard's promised fire, and smoked and chatted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look just the same, old boy,&rdquo; said Leonard, scanning Darley
      carefully. &ldquo;But the hair is a little thin in front there, and I think I
      see the growing spot of baldness, as Ike Marvel has it. Did you ever read
      that great book of his, 'A Bachelor's Reveries?' No? Well, you should. I
      find it sweetest company. Yes, you are the same old sobersides&mdash;a
      great deal deeper than you look, as the little boy said when he fell into
      the well. And not married yet, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, the little boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you, you rogue! I should have thought you would have gone off long
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hard question to answer. Are we not always in a condition of mild
      wonder that our friends have not gone over to the married ranks, when we
      ourselves have not? However, from floating gossip&mdash;that tongue's
      flotsam&mdash;I have heard that you meditate going over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Darley, pricking up his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Leonard, knocking the ashes out of his pipe, &ldquo;Beau Brummel
      cannot pay court to a beauty without the world knowing it! I, even I, have
      heard of Miss Bella Charteris. She is not the sort of girl, if I may make
      so bold, that I would have imagined you pinning yourself to. I should have
      thought some quiet, sober, angelic little woman like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was going to say like her sister,&rdquo; said Leonard softly, bending
      his head over his pipe as he slowly refilled it. &ldquo;But you do not know her
      sister, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I did not even know Miss Charteris had a sister!&rdquo; exclaimed Dar-ley
      in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Why, Miss Florence Charteris lives here&mdash;in Dutton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Charteris mentioned an aunt, and hinted at some one else whom she
      said I would see, now that I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irony, I suppose,&rdquo; said Leonard quietly, smiling a queer little smile.
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Charteris the second lives in Dutton: a quaint, gray little
      life, good, patient, and God-like. She is the sweet angel of Dutton. But
      tell me, Percy, are you in love with your Miss Charteris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid she is not my Miss Charteris,&rdquo; said Darley, smiling. &ldquo;And to
      be candid with you, Jack, I am not in love with her&mdash;for which,
      perhaps, I should be thankful. However, if Miss Charteris <i>does</i>
      accept me, which I think is highly improbable, I shall marry her for
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard shook his head. &ldquo;I thought that was the way the wind lay,&rdquo; he said
      sagaciously. &ldquo;Don't do it,&rdquo; he added tersely, after a pause. &ldquo;Take an old
      fool's advice&mdash;don't do it. I think you would only live to regret
      having sold yourself into bondage. That is what it would amount to in your
      case. You are not built upon rough enough lines, I know, not to care at
      having your poverty sneered at and constantly thrown in your face. It is a
      puzzle to me how any man with any sense of independence and honor can sell
      himself, as some men do; and it is beyond my understanding how <i>you</i>,
      with your fine feelings and high ideal of manhood, ever thought of such a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly rubbing it in, Dar-ley thought. But, then, Leonard was
      such an exceptionally odd fellow, with his one-man-in-a-million code of
      chivalry and his ethical eccentricities. Still, Darley shrunk at the
      castigation, because he knew that the feelings that prompted it were
      sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am terribly in debt, Jack,&rdquo; he said, almost deprecatingly. &ldquo;What is
      there left for me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there left? The opportunity to fight it out!&rdquo; retorted Leonard.
      &ldquo;Retrench. In a year, or two at most, unless you are <i>hopelessly</i>
      insolvent, if you live without the profitless pleasures that have brought
      you to this pass, you can come out triumphantly independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley shook his head. &ldquo;I am afraid I could not stand the strain, Jack,&rdquo;
       he answered, almost sadly. &ldquo;A fellow of your caliber might. How is it, by
      the way, that you yourself are still in single harness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was silent, gazing in the coals with almost a melancholy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should not say so,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;yet you have been so
      frank with me; but I do not like the subject when applied to myself.
      However, there is but one answer, which is embodied in that one word that
      hangs like a pall before the eyes of the young literary aspirant&mdash;<i>refused</i>.
      I shall always be single, Darley. Always the same old solitary sixpence,
      with my rods and guns and dogs and books. Not bad companions, all of them,
      when used well&mdash;faithful, too. Eh, Rosy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful hound addressed raised her head and looked pathetically at
      her master, rubbing her nose in a sympathetic way against his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley felt deeply interested. &ldquo;What was the trouble, old fellow?&rdquo; he
      ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole story is contained in that one word&mdash;refused. I never
      cared for but one woman; and <i>she</i> did not care for me&mdash;at
      least, not enough to marry. Which was, after all, the most natural thing
      in the world, I suppose. I could not blame her, could I, since I would
      only marry for love myself? It is not much of a story, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think there is a great deal in it!&rdquo; answered Darley,
      warmly. &ldquo;I think I see that you loved this woman as only men with hearts
      like yours can love&mdash;once and for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loved her? My love has no past participle, Darley! I shall always love
      her! I shall always think her the sweetest woman in the world, and the
      best! There is no other like her&mdash;God bless her! But you are sleepy,
      old fellow; and even Rosy is yawning and thinks it is time all decent
      people went to bed. Let us have one of the old-time horns, one of those
      old camp-fire nips&mdash;and then to bed. To-morrow you shall see our
      little town. By the way, did you bring your skates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skates! I haven't seen one for five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. I have a dozen pairs, and I dare say we can fit you. Do you
      curl? No? Well, you shall learn. We have the finest rink within a hundred
      miles. Here's your room, old fellow! Good-night, and rosy dreams and
      slumbers bright, as Sir Walter says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The days passed happily for Darley. The ice was perfect; and though he had
      not skated for years, his old power over the art came swiftly back. The
      river was one glaring, narrow, indefinite sheet of incomparable ice. Then
      there was the curling-rink, of which Leonard was an ardent devotee. It is
      a quiet, satisfying sport, this &ldquo;roaring&rdquo; game, and has peculiar charms
      for the man who has turned forty. The snow-bird shooting was good, too,
      out in the broad white fields beyond the town. And one glittering night
      the pair drove out into the country, and went on a hunt after some
      depredatory foxes with some farmers. They did not get the foxes; but they
      had a jolly supper at the farm-house, and an eight-hand reel in the
      kitchen, which Darley thoroughly enjoyed&mdash;more, he affirmed to his
      black-eyed partner, than any ball in the city he had ever attended.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, Leonard having some business to detain him, Darley went off
      alone for the customary spin down the river. Skating out of the town and
      away past the white fields and the farmhouses, he presently espied a small
      feminine figure ahead of him, gliding quietly along. Suddenly the figure
      tripped and fell. One skate had come off and flew out to the center of the
      ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley sped to the rescue. The little figure in gray made a futile attempt
      to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0047" id="linkimage-0047"> </a>

      <a href="images/0252.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; exclaimed the rescuer as he wheeled to a short stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady looked up, and Darley saw the likeness in an instant. It was the
      other Miss Charteris&mdash;not at all like his acquaintance of the city. A
      rather pale, patient little face, with quiet gray eyes set far apart; a
      plain face, Darley said to himself. But on second thought he decided that
      it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have hurt my ankle,&rdquo; said this little woman in answer to
      Darley's inquiry. &ldquo;I tried to stand up, but I got a twinge that told me
      something was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me help you. Which foot is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one,&rdquo; indicating the foot minus the skate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley lifted her up. &ldquo;Now you keep the injured member off the ice,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and I will skate you to shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my fault,&rdquo; said the patient, as Darley knelt down and removed
      the remaining skate. &ldquo;I would put on these old-fashioned things just
      because the blades are splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley secured the refractory skate and removed his own. Then he asked how
      the ankle felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charteris attempted to stand upon both feet, but sat down upon the
      bank instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>does</i> hurt,&rdquo; she said, as if unwilling to admit the painful
      fact. She looked at Darley almost appealingly, then about her. The nearest
      house was a quarter of a mile away. Finally she looked back at Darley,
      with an expression that seemed to say, What are we going to do now, I
      wonder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley made up his mind quickly. He always did when a woman was in the
      question. &ldquo;You can't walk,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shall have to carry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charteris' pale cheeks assumed a rapid flush. &ldquo;I can walk,&rdquo; she said,
      hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Darley, gently. &ldquo;Take my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few painful steps proved to Miss Charteris that she <i>could</i> walk,
      at the expense of excruciating agony. So, being a sensible little soul,
      she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it is impossible,&rdquo; said her knight. &ldquo;You will have to let me
      carry you, Miss Charteris. I beg your pardon for not introducing myself. I
      am Mr. Percy Darley, a guest at Mr. John Leonard's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you were Mr. Darley, but I don't see how you knew that I was Miss
      Charteris,&rdquo; said that young lady, looking surprised, and quite forgetting
      her ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the pleasure of knowing your sister, and I recognized the
      likeness,&rdquo; answered Darley, truthfully. &ldquo;Now, will you allow me? Or I am
      afraid I shall have to take the law into my own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not the law,&rdquo; retorted Miss Charteris, attempting to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very reason that I should become the law,&rdquo; answered Darley, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can <i>hop</i>,&rdquo; said the girl, desperately. She did so for a
      few yards, and then came to a last halt. Hopping through deep snow proved
      rather heavy exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to carry me,&rdquo; she said in a tone of surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley picked her up. She was no weight, this little gray thing, and
      Darley was an athletic young man. Despite the snow, it did not take him
      long to reach the farm-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer's wife was a kind soul, and knew Miss Charteris. She also knew
      a sprain, she said, when she saw one; and Miss Charteris' ankle was
      sprained. So, while the injured member was being attended to by the deft
      hand of the farmer's wife, Darley posted off to the town for Miss
      Charteris' aunt's sleigh, the farmer being absent with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley secured the sleigh, drove back to the farm-house, and his charge,
      her ankle warmly and carefully wrapped up, was placed in the cutter and
      driven home. The family doctor had already arrived, and Darley took his
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I call and see how you are get-ing on?&rdquo; he ventured as he said
      good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy if you will,&rdquo; said Miss Charteris. But the gray eyes
      seemed to say to Darley, Could you think of not doing so?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are in love, or on the way,&rdquo; said this young man to
      himself as he walked briskly to his friend's house. &ldquo;In love, young
      fellow, and with a real woman, not a woman of the world, but a genuine
      sweet woman, one worth the loving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He related the story as simply as he could to Leonard, and the latter
      listened quietly. But Darley did not observe the odd look in his friend's
      eyes during the narration, nor did he guess that Leonard was saying to
      himself, Ah! my young friend, and have you, too, fallen at the first
      shaft?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go round to the rink?&rdquo; suggested Leonard the following evening,
      after dinner, as they sat over their pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will stroll round and see how Miss Charteris is,&rdquo; said Darley,
      smoking furiously. &ldquo;I will call in at the rink afterward, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, old fellow,&rdquo; was all Leonard said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley found Miss Charteris' ankle improved. The doctor had pronounced it
      a severe sprain, had prescribed some wonderful liniment, and had
      alleviated the pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall not be able to be out again for three weeks,&rdquo; said the
      invalid, plaintively, on the occasion of a second visit of anxious
      inquiry. &ldquo;It is too bad; for I think open-air skating the most
      exhilarating of all sport! It always seems to lift me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't seem to lift you up yesterday,&rdquo; suggested Darley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. I have thought since that I should be very grateful to you,
      because, if you had not happened along, I am sure I don't know what I
      should have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk like that, please,&rdquo; said Darley, gravely. It is wonderful the
      aversion a young man has to being thanked in a case of this sort&mdash;at
      least, his profession of dislike. &ldquo;I cannot tell you how unfortunate I
      regard the doctor's mandate,&rdquo; said Darley after one of those awkward
      pauses between two young people who fancy, on a short acquaintance, that
      they have a tender regard for each other. &ldquo;On your own account, of course,
      because I can understand how you feel over losing such a chance as the
      present ice affords; but chiefly, I am selfish enough to say, on my own
      behalf, because by the time you are able to skate again, even if the ice
      is still good, my visit will have come to an end; and I had been hoping,
      presumptuously enough, I know, to see you often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be really imperative for you to return so soon?&rdquo; said Miss
      Charteris, working rapidly at the woolen hood on which she was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; answered Darley, with something very like a sigh. &ldquo;I
      could not infringe on too much of Leonard's time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is not the city which calls, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not the city,&rdquo; answered Darley, laughing, and being angrily
      conscious that he was flushing. &ldquo;But Jack is such a dear good fellow, that
      I know he would not dream of sending me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charteris' eyes were on her work, and she plied her fingers rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Leonard very well, Miss Charteris?&rdquo; continued Darley, as the
      girl did not venture a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; The tone might have suggested that Miss Charteris was agitated;
      but Darley went on, radiant and sublimely ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a grand fellow&mdash;the one man in the world that I would fall
      down and worship! I think Shakespeare must have had him in his vaticinal
      eye when he put those perfect words, that immortal eulogy, in the mouth of
      Antony: 'His life was gentle; and the elements so mixed in him that Nature
      might stand up and say to all the world, '<i>this</i> was a man!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid came in and asked if she should light the lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just yet. I prefer this twilight. Do you, Mr. Darley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much&mdash;for itself. It is very satisfying and soothing, and
      always seems to me like a benediction. But it is very bad for your eyes,
      and very soon I shall be only able to half see your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will be very good for <i>your</i> eyes. Well, I have done work for
      today.&rdquo; Miss Charteris laid the hood away, which Darley had been regarding
      curiously, and folded her hands in her lap. The action and the moment made
      Darley think of the &ldquo;Angelus;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; made him think that it was
      getting late, and that made him think that it was time to go. The lamps,
      he said, had come round, and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sit down, unless you really want to go,&rdquo; said Miss Charteris. She was
      remarkably frank, this young lady. &ldquo;The lamps have not come round; and, on
      the contrary, I think that my disinclination for them should be taken as
      proof that I do not think it is time for you to go. Besides, the days are
      cruelly short now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find them so,&rdquo; answered Darley, softly. &ldquo;Leonard is making everything
      so comfortable for me that I do not know what I shall feel like when the
      curtain has rung down. It will seem like awaking suddenly from dreamland
      to cold earth again. I am sure I shall feel like one of those mountains
      falling into the sea of dullness that Poe describes: 'Mountains toppling
      evermore into seas without a shore.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem a great admirer of Mr. Leonard,&rdquo; ventured Miss Charteris. There
      was just the slightest suspicion of jealousy in her tone, which Darley did
      not notice. Was it because he had inadvertently attributed his loneliness
      at leaving to his friend's kindness, and not paid her that little tribute
      of homage which women love? But who knoweth the heart of woman? Darley
      longed to tell her why he should feel lonely when he came to say good-by;
      but he did not wish to garnish such a declaration with quotations from
      poets. Let a man speak from the inspiration of the moment when he tells
      his love, or hints at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirer!&rdquo; he echoed, in reply to Miss Charteris' remark. &ldquo;It is more than
      that. Just think! We were inseparable for years. I wish we had remained
      so. No one who knows Jack Leonard as I have known him could help thinking
      him a perfect man, noble and generous, as he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are one in that opinion,&rdquo; answered Miss Charteris, quietly. &ldquo;And, next
      to esteeming a noble man, I can esteem his friend who can speak so
      unselfishly and sincerely of him, as you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley felt touched&mdash;not so much at the words, but at the way in
      which they were spoken, gently, deeply, as if breathing of sincereness.
      But he did not distinguish anything beyond that in the grave eulogy to
      Leonard and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the lights <i>had</i> to be brought in, and Darley rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you felt it unfortunate that I should be unable to skate,
      because you had been hoping to see me often,&rdquo; said Miss Charteris. She was
      conscious of a slight flush, but she went bravely on. In certain
      circumstances a woman <i>has</i> to be what prudes call bold. &ldquo;Did you
      mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you doubt that I meant it? I certainly did mean it.&rdquo; Darley was
      a little confused by this frankness. All true women must be coquettes in
      some degree, was Darley's creed. But Miss Charteris was hardly a coquette
      even in a slight degree, he thought. It was not frivolousness that
      prompted her to speak in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if you meant it,&rdquo; continued this charming young person, &ldquo;I shall
      be glad if you will come and see me as often as you like, if you will not
      find it dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spooner, Miss Charteris' aunt, came in at this moment and spoiled the
      eloquent look of reproach that Darley gave her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Spooner in her high but
      pleasant voice. Miss Spooner's speech was emphatic, and endowed with
      realism. Darley felt like saying that he never had, indeed. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      never did! Going into mourning, I believe, because she can't go out and
      break another ankle! You wouldn't catch <i>me</i> on that ice! I saw it
      to-day from the bridge&mdash;horrible, shiny, treacherous stuff! Not going
      already, Mr. Darley? Better stop to tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley said he could not stop to tea <i>that evening</i>; which meant that
      he could some other evening, of course, and would be unspeakably happy to
      do so. All of which Miss Spooner understood; and so she extended her
      hospitality to him for the next evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Percy, I believe you are going to marry Miss Charteris,&rdquo;
       said Leonard, quietly, one evening. &ldquo;<i>Our</i> Miss Charteris, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are in love with her; in fact, I know you are. And I hope
      you will. Nothing could make me happier.&rdquo; Darley looked the satisfaction
      he could not speak at this little speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in love with her. But I am not good enough for her,&rdquo; he said,
      humbly. &ldquo;I have been a worthless beggar all these years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can prove your worth,&rdquo; said Leonard, warmly. &ldquo;And you <i>must</i>, if
      you marry Florence Charteris. I know you are not worthless; but you must
      let the good come to the surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall work,&rdquo; answered Darley, earnestly. &ldquo;I begin to feel now the
      approving glow that comes to a man when he anticipates marrying a woman he
      loves. But why should I anticipate? I have not the slightest reason to
      believe that Miss Charteris cares a jot for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true, Percy?&rdquo; questioned Leonard, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darley did not know whether it was true or not. He did not like to be
      sanguine, he said. No; he had no reason to think Miss Charteris cared
      whether he went back to town to-morrow. Not an item of which Leonard
      believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope earnestly you will win her,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;But you will have to
      retrench. Florence Charteris is as poor as a church mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am heartily glad of it,&rdquo; said Darley, warmly. &ldquo;I shall be the man I
      have never yet been if I win her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will win her,&rdquo; said Leonard. &ldquo;I feel it in my bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the days went round; and each one found Darley at Miss Spooner's. Even
      little Dutton had begun to watch with interest the outcome of this quiet
      wooing of the little lady whom all the town loved. The evolutions of
      acquaintance had merged rapidly into the sweeter plane of an almost
      wordless courtship; but as yet Darley had not ventured to speak He felt
      fearful lest his dream should be dispelled; and yet, though he was not a
      vain man, he felt that this lovable little woman cared for him. He could
      not go back to town and leave his love unspoken, however; because if he
      had done so this little story would not have been written. And at length
      came the day when he felt that his visit had been prolonged beyond the
      limits that even close friendship allows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away to-morrow,&rdquo; he said on this eventful afternoon. It was
      just such an afternoon as that first one which he had spent there. It was
      growing dusk; and through the window they could see the red lights of
      home, those terrestrial apostles of Hesperus, punctuating the white
      landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away to-morrow,&rdquo; repeated Darley. Miss Charteris said nothing,
      but gazed out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you say something?&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Have you nothing to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I say? Do you want me to say good-by? Is it such a sweet
      word, then, that you are anxious that I should say it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley knelt beside the little dusky figure in the rocker. How sweet it is
      to have the woman you love speak to you like this, and to hear her voice
      tremble, and to feel that she cares for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't want you to say good-by,&rdquo; he said, very gently. &ldquo;I want you
      to tell me not to go. Can't you see that the thought of leaving you has
      been like the thought of eternal darkness to me? I love you, and I want
      you for my own, always, that I may never know the bitterness of good-by!&rdquo;
       Miss Charteris turned her head, and Darley saw that the gray eyes he loved
      so well were wet. She put out one little white hand till it rested on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, when the lamps&mdash;those horribly real and unromantic
      things&mdash;were brought in, they talked of other matters. But both
      seemed very happy, and ready to talk of anything. Even the mysterious
      hood, which was now completed, came in for a share of attention, and the
      inquisitive Darley learned that it was for a &ldquo;poor old soul,&rdquo; as Miss
      Charteris expressed it, who lived in a wretched little shanty with a
      worthless grandson, at the other end of the town. By-and-by Miss Charteris
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some news for you. Bella was married yesterday. Can you guess to
      whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot,&rdquo; answered Darley, almost breathlessly. Bella was the Miss
      Charteris of the city. He did not know whether to feel glad or
      indifferent, but he was free of the gentlest touch of spleen. A woman will
      be conscious of a twinge of pique when she hears that a man with whom she
      has had some little love affair has married some one else. But Darley was
      not conscious of any such sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very quiet,&rdquo; continued Miss Charteris. &ldquo;At least, I gather so from
      the paper which tells me of it. Bella never writes me, and not even on
      this occasion has she done so. However, she is now Mrs. Lawrence
      Severance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Darley in a superior tone, which testified that he knew
      something about it. Then he mentioned having met Severance. He had not
      said anything of the occurrence before, not caring for Miss Charteris of
      the city as a subject of conversation with her sister, for reasons best
      known to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is quite a little story about it, you know,&rdquo; continued Miss
      Florence. &ldquo;Lawrence, you know, and Bella have been lovers ever since they
      were so high, and Bella was Aunt Mary Spooner's favorite. When Aunt Mary
      died she left a great deal of money for Bella when she should come of age,
      stipulating, however, that Bella should have only a certain allowance till
      she was beyond a marriageable age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, what age is that?&rdquo; asked Darley, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have cared to ask Aunt Mary that question. The reason was
      that Lawrence was the son of an old sweetheart of Aunt Mary's, who had
      jilted her without any mercy; and so the sins of the father were visited
      upon the head of the son. 'Marry Lawrence, my dear,' says Aunt Mary, 'if
      you like, but you don't have my money. Florence shall have it the day you
      marry Lawrence Severance.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley started as if stung. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I don't understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen. 'Oh, ho!' quoth Lawrence, when he grew up and understood the
      story. 'So that is the way of love, is it? Well, there are more fortunes
      than Aunt Mary's in the world.' And away went Lawrence, nothing daunted,
      to win&mdash;what I hear he has won&mdash;double the fortune that Bella,
      in marrying him, hands over to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you mean to say that this&mdash;money comes to you; that you are a
      rich woman, in fact?&rdquo; Darley's tone was almost bitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; answered Miss Florence, gleefully, and clapping her little hands.
      &ldquo;Aren't you glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad? I hate it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hate it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, hate it! I was glorying in the fact that if I won you I would marry
      a poor woman. Now&mdash;&rdquo; Darley did not finish his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not talk like that,&rdquo; said Miss Florence with some asperity. &ldquo;It
      is very wrong, and it hurts me, although I know I should be pleased. But I
      know you love me for all that. Money is a very good thing&mdash;God's gift
      in the hands of those who use it well. There is a great deal of good that
      we can do with Aunt Mary's money. She was very good herself to the poor,
      despite her unnatural dislike for Lawrence Severance; and I should like
      her to know that her mantle had fallen on worthy shoulders. You and I
      shall use this money to a great purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know what a happy thing it has been to me, this thought of
      winning you and proving my love by earnest work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And need that resolve be dissipated?&rdquo; said Miss Florence, gravely. &ldquo;You
      shall do that. There is a great deal of work to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard met Darley on his return, and drew him into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have won her, Jack!&rdquo; said the younger man, grasping his friend's hand.
      &ldquo;The sweetest and the noblest woman God ever made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it in your face,&rdquo; said Leonard, huskily. Even Darley could not fail
      to notice the change in his friend's voice. &ldquo;What is the matter, old man?&rdquo;
       he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing, my boy,&rdquo; Leonard answered quickly. &ldquo;But promise me one
      thing: that you will make her a noble husband, always&mdash;always!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Darley understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Jack!&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;What a fool I have been! Can you
      forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to forgive, my boy&mdash;nothing. But you must always be
      good to her. But never get angry because another man besides yourself
      worships your wife.&rdquo;

      HE story I am about to narrate happened this way, Thomas Burke and I were
      old schoolmates. But his course and mine had been widely divergent for a
      score of years, so that by the time he had brought his family back to New
      York, and our acquaintance could be renewed, many untold things had
      happened to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew Tom had won his fortune by mining in the Rocky Mountains. It was
      rumored that his accomplished wife also had wealth in her own right, but
      Tom never had much to say in regard to his financial matters, and I did
      not like to question him notwithstanding our intimacy. I had dined with
      him two Christmases in succession, and now for the third time had eaten my
      Christmas dinner at his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each of these occasions Mrs. Burke had worn at her throat a magificient
      brooch which I had never seen at any other time, though I had met her
      often when such an ornament would have been suitable enough. This brooch
      was a bear's face, holding in its teeth a tiny steel key. It was a marvel
      of delicacy in the goldsmith's art, and evidently very costly; for the
      eyes were each a ruby, and the head was encircled with large diamonds,
      half hidden by hairs of gold, as though they represented a collar round
      bruin's hirsute neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; I said, when Mrs. Burke had left us to ourselves after dinner, &ldquo;I
      am very curious about that bear's head brooch your wife wears. Why do I
      never see it except at Christmas? I am sure it has a history, and if there
      is no secret about it I wish you would enlighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my old friend, &ldquo;that is rather a lengthy story. There is no
      secret about it&mdash;at least none to keep from an old chum like you. As
      for the brooch, that's only an ornament I had made some years ago; but the
      design and the little key&mdash;which is a real key&mdash;remind Marion
      and myself of what we call our Christmas story, because it culminated on
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you and I left the old university in 1870, and you came here, and I
      went West&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But if I were to tell the story as he did, it would hardly be as plain to
      you as it was to me. I must write it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom Burke left the university after his graduation he took the few
      hundred dollars which were the measure of his capital and went to the
      Rocky Mountains to seek his fortune. In the autumn of 1871 he became the
      superintendent of the Crimson Canyon Mining Company in Southern Colorado,
      where he found as assayer, and scientific assistant generally, a queer,
      learned and proud old Scotchman named Corbitt. This man had been one of
      the &ldquo;Forty-niners&rdquo; and had made a fortune which he had greatly enjoyed
      while it lasted, and the loss of which, in some wrong-headed speculation,
      he never ceased to deplore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, a few weeks before Tom's arrival at the camp, Corbitt's home had been
      brightened by the coming of his daughter Marion, on what he told his
      envious acquaintances was a &ldquo;veesit,&rdquo; implying that she could not be
      expected to make her home there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And truly this remote mountain settlement, inclement in climate, uncouth,
      dusty, filled with rough men, and bountiful only in pure air and divine
      pictures of crag and glen, icy-blue peaks and chromatic patches of stained
      cliff above or flower meadow below&mdash;all this was anything but the
      sort of place for a girl like her to spend her maiden days in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was not quite a case of love at first sight between her and
      Tom, but certainly the winter had not passed before each had confessed
      that there was no one else in the world beside the other whose presence
      much mattered in the way of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that seemed to be the end of it, for Corbitt gave young Burke to
      understand most decisively that he could hope for nothing more&mdash;an
      engagement to marry was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, let us wait,&rdquo; was Marion's last word, when, on her first and last
      tryst, she had stolen away to meet him, and he counted her kisses as a
      miser counts his gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait. I care for nobody else, and nobody can marry me against my
      will. We are young yet. Who knows what may happen? You may get money
      enough to satisfy papa&mdash;I don't suppose he holds me at a very, very
      high price, do you? Or I may be freer after a while to do as I wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was commonplace advice enough, but Tom saw both the good sense and
      the pure love in it, and accepted the decree, steeling his heart against
      the impulses of rage and revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, quite unexpectedly, Mr. Corbitt resigned his place and went to
      Denver, taking his family with him. The same week the mine changed owners,
      and Burke was superseded by a new superintendent; and so, almost at a
      stroke, the lad lost both his sweetheart and the weapon by which he was to
      fight for her in the business tournament of the world. However, the latter
      evil was presently remedied, and he worked on, saving his money and
      teasing his brain for suggestions how to make it increase faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time the mighty range had never been very carefully prospected.
      Men had, indeed, ascended Crimson Creek to its sources in search of the
      deposits of quartz whence the auriferous gravels below had been enriched,
      but they had brought back a discouraging report. Tom was not satisfied to
      accept their conclusions. He was confident, from the geological and other
      indications, that treasures of ore lay undiscovered among those azure
      heights. At last, resolved to see for himself, he enlisted the help of a
      young miner and mountaineer named Cooper, and one day late in August they
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing the pillared gateways of the Canyon, and ascending for a few
      miles the great gorge down which the creek cascaded over boulders and
      ledges of granite and rounded fragments of trachyte and quartz, you come
      to a noble cataract leaping into the Canyon from the left through a narrow
      gash or depression in the wall. By climbing up the opposite slope a little
      way, you see that this stream comes tumbling white and furious down a long
      rugged stairway of rocky fragments before it reaches the brink, whence it
      shoots out in the air and then falls in a thousand wreaths of dangling
      vapor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cooper,&rdquo; Tom called out to his companion, who was more comrade than
      servant, &ldquo;I guess we'll camp here. I want to examine this side gorge a
      bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; remarked Tom, &ldquo;as if this had formerly been the main
      stream, and had carried pretty much all the drainage of the valley until a
      big landslide&mdash;and it didn't happen so very long ago either&mdash;dammed
      the exit of the valley and changed the shape of things generally, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about the size of it, I guess. But, I say, ain't that smoke down
      there by the lake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0053" id="linkimage-0053"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0276.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon we've got time enough to go and see. It ain't far down there,
      and the moon'll show us the way back if we get late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noting their bearings, they began the descent toward the lake and
      presently came out upon its border, where the walking was easier.
      Advancing cautiously half a mile or thereabout, they again caught sight of
      the smoke through the bushes&mdash;a feeble column rising from some embers
      before a small shelter of boughs and bark that hardly deserved the name of
      hut. A skillet, a light pick and shovel, and one or two other household
      articles lay near by, but nothing alive appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Injun 'bout that,&rdquo; said Cooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cooper; more likely a prospector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hallooing as they neared the hut, a lean and miserable dog rushed out and
      greeted them with ferocious growls, whereupon they heard a weak voice
      speaking to him, and saw a frowsy gray head and a bony hand, clutching a
      revolver, stretched out of the opening that answered for a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0054" id="linkimage-0054"> </a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0284.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Tom cried. &ldquo;Call off your dog; we're friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a tousled, ragged, gaunt-limbed figure, emaciated with hunger, wild
      eyed with fever, dragged itself from the sheltering brush, gave one long
      look at the stalwart strangers, and fell back on the stony ground in a
      dead faint, while the dog, rushing forward with the courage of a starved
      wolf, planted himself before the corpse-like form and defied them to touch
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fought off the animal, brought water from the lake and revived the
      man. A dram from Tom's flask stimulated him, whereupon he sat up and began
      to chatter incoherently, thanks to God and wild exclamations about some
      hidden treasure mingling with such plaintive cries as &ldquo;She'll be all right
      now!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mebbe she'll forgive her old dad!&rdquo; making up the whole of his
      ceaseless talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's clean crazy!&rdquo; was Cooper's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom assented, &ldquo;but it is fever and famine. Couldn't you shoot a
      rabbit or something? Then I could make him a stew. Try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all that Cooper could quickly find to kill were three mountain jays,
      which were converted into a broth, thickened with the dust of flour that
      remained. A little tea was also found in the sick man's pack, and this was
      brewed for him. Then Cooper volunteered to go back to their own camp and
      bring over more food and Tom's little medicine case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he fetched the rest of their luggage, and in the afternoon
      shot a deer. So they encamped here beside the lake and nursed the old
      fellow until his fever subsided and the delirium had ceased to a great
      extent. Then by easy stages, partly carrying him on a stretcher, partly
      assisting him to walk, they managed to take him back to Crimson Camp and
      gave him a bed in Tom's cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the strain of this effort had been too much for the aged and feeble
      frame. No sooner was the excitement of the march at an end than a relapse
      occurred, and for a fortnight the old man hovered on the edge of death;
      skill and care seemed to conquer, however, and one morning peace came to
      the tortured brain and the old prospector began to get better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at last he was awake, with seeming intelligence in his eyes, asking
      where he was and who were the people around him. Tom explained and then
      questioned him in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mystery was not to be so easily solved. The invalid could not tell
      his name, nor where he had come from. He said he had been prospecting all
      his life&mdash;where&mdash;how long&mdash;all particulars were a blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't remember anything but the cache&mdash;nothing else at all,&rdquo; he
      declared, gazing piteously into one face after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about that, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his bosom and drew out the little pouch. It was opened for him
      and its contents&mdash;a fragment of quartz heavy with gold and a tiny
      steel key&mdash;taken out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What do you call that?&rdquo; he inquired eagerly, pointing to the yellow
      metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Well, there is lots of that in my cache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your cache?&rdquo; inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow dropped his head and tried to think, but couldn't clutch
      any of the motes of memory dodging like phantasmagoria before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell,&rdquo; he confessed, with infinite sadness. &ldquo;I reckon I'd know
      the place if I saw it. And I've forgotten everything before that, but it
      seems to me that I fell a great ways, and lay for years and years with an
      awful pain in my head. Then all at once my head got better and I opened my
      eyes&mdash;mebbe it was a dream&mdash;and there I and the dog were in a
      little camp 'way up a big gulch. I knew the place, but I felt kind o' weak
      and dizzy-like and 'lowed I'd make a cache o' all my stuff, and go down to
      Del Nort' and see a doctor. So I dug a hole beside a big rock that had a
      peculiar mark on it, and put into it most o' my grub and some papers, and
      a lot o' that yellow stuff&mdash;what d'ye call it?&mdash;and reckoned
      they'd be safe till I come back in three or four weeks. I can remember all
      about the cache and my camp there, and my leavin' it and climbin' down a
      devilish steep place, and there I stop and can't remember nothin' since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was absolutely all that was left of the man's memory, and, though he
      was now quite sane, he had to be taught the names and uses of many of the
      commonest objects. Moreover, he seemed to grow weaker instead of stronger,
      and after a few days the physician announced that his patient's end was
      near. When the old fellow was told this he called Tom to his bedside, and
      said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardner, you've done the square thing by me, and I want you to have half
      the traps in that cache after I've passed in my checks, and give the other
      half to&mdash;to&mdash;oh, God! Now I can't remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his face brightened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the letters'll tell! Read the letters and give her half of it. I'll
      sign a paper if you'll write it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So a will was made, and the dying man made a mark before witness, in lieu
      of the signature he had lost the power to make, and the next day he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miners generally believed the stranger's story of this cache to be a
      figment of his disordered imagination, and Tom himself might have yielded
      to this theory had not the physician assured him that there was a fair
      chance of its truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tom preserved the will, the quartz and the key, hoping that chance
      might sometime disclose the treasure trove if there were any; and a few
      days later he and young Cooper started a second time on their prospecting
      tour. This time they took a burro with them, and so were able to carry a
      small tent and outfit for a fortnight's trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      By active marching they reached the lake that night, finding it slow work
      to get their unwilling donkey up the steep rocks at the fall, by a
      circuitous trail and aided by some actual lifting of the little beast.
      They researched the hut, but found nothing new. The dog, now fat and
      strong, and a devoted friend, accompanied them and betrayed most excitedly
      his recognition of the bivouac. Next morning they made their way up to the
      head of the lake, where the breadth of the gulch and the appearance of
      things confirmed Tom's previous surmise that this was originally the main
      channel of drainage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were true they ought to get evidence of drift gold; and several
      days were spent in panning the gravels (nowhere, however, of great
      extent), with most encouraging results. A few miles above the lake they
      found the gulch forked into two ravines divided by a rocky spur. They
      chose the right-hand one and lost three days in fruitless exploration of
      its bed and walls. Shep (the dog was a collie and they had rechristened
      him) did not display anything like the joy he had shown in the advance up
      the main stream, and when they finally returned to the forks they could
      not but notice his renewed spirits. The dog was again all eagerness, and
      intensely delighted when on the following morning they started up the
      left-hand gulch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as though his master had come down that way, doesn't it?&rdquo; said
      Tom. &ldquo;Maybe he could guide us right back to where he came from; but he'll
      have to wait a while, for I like the look of that crag up there,&rdquo;
       directing his companion's attention to the crest of the wall on the left,
      &ldquo;and I want to examine it. You'd better stay here and try to get a
      blacktail. Bacon three times a day is getting monotonous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think you'd better take the Winchester?&rdquo; said Cooper. (They had
      brought but one rifle.) &ldquo;You might hit up against a grizzly or a mountain
      lion. I heard one of 'em screeching last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can't lug a gun. I've got my six shooter, and I'll risk it. Come
      on, Shep! It's noon now, and we won't get back to supper if we don't
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog raced gleefully ahead as the young man strode up the gulch,
      scanning its rugged slope in search of a convenient place to begin the
      ascent, and presently, as though cognizant of the plan, the dog turned
      aside and with loud barking and much tail wagging invited attention to a
      dry watercourse that offered a sort of path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you're right, Shep,&rdquo; Tom assented, and set his face to the sturdy
      climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half way up a ledge, covered with cedars and Spanish bayonet, made the
      ascent really arduous for a little way, and here the dog, which as usual
      was some rods in advance, suddenly began barking furiously, and capering
      around a small object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chipmunk, I reckon,&rdquo; said Tom to himself, as he scrambled on, short of
      breath; but when Shep came sliding down, holding in his mouth a battered
      old felt hat, curiosity changed to amazement. The dog growled at first,
      and refused to give up his prize, but after a little coaxing yielded it
      into Tom's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old prospector had had no hat when found. Could this be it? It did not
      seem to have lain out of doors long, and the dog would hardly show so much
      interest unless his sharp nose had recognized it as something belonging to
      his former inaster. Closely scrutinizing, Tom found tucked into the lining
      a slip of sweat-stained paper with a name upon it&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      ARTHUR F. PIERSON,
    </h3>
    <p>
      Tucsony Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stuffing the hat into his pocket Tom scrambled on, thinking out the
      meaning of the incident; and now he began to notice in this steeper place
      that some of the boulders had been misplaced, and here and there was a
      broken branch, as, if someone had descended very hastily or clumsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that crazy old man came down here, and perhaps caught a second bad
      fall, I don't wonder he was used up by the time he reached the lake&rdquo; was
      Tom's mental ejaculation, as he toiled up the acclivity and at last,
      panting and leg weary, gained a narrow grassy level at the foot of a crag
      &ldquo;spiked with firs,&rdquo; which had been conspicuous from the valley not only by
      its height and castellated battlements, but because a colossal X was
      formed on its face by two broad veins of quartz crossing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his eyes fixed upon the rocky wall he walked along in the face of a
      stiff breeze, until he noticed a pinkish streak upon the dark cliff,
      betokening the outcrop of another vein, and turned aside to climb a pile
      of fallen fragments at the foot of the crag to reach it. These fragments
      were overgrown with low, dense shrubbery. He ducked his head and was
      pushing into them, when suddenly he saw a huge brown body rise almost into
      his face, heard the tremendous growl of a grizzly, and amid a crash of
      bushes and dislodged stones felt himself hurled backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clutching instinctively at one of the shrubs as he fell, he whirled under
      its hiding foliage, and the vicious stroke of the bear's paw came down
      upon his leg instead of his head, while the released branches snapped
      upward into the face of the brute, which, as much surprised as its victim,
      paused in its onslaught to collect its wits. An instant later Shep dashed
      up, and at the bear's hindquarters. Bruin spasmodically sank his claws
      deeper into Tom's thigh, but turned his head and shoulders with a terrific
      ursine oath at this new and most palpable enemy; and ten seconds afterward
      Tom's revolver, its muzzle pressed close underneath the bear's ear, had
      emptied half an ounce of lead into its brain. A blood-freezing death
      squeal tore the air, and the ponderous carcass sank down, stone dead, upon
      Tom's body and upon the dwarfed spruce which covered it. It pinned him to
      the ground with an almost insupportable weight. Perhaps if the animal
      alone had lain upon him he might have wriggled out; but the brute's
      carcass also held down the tough and firmly-rooted tree, and the rocks on
      each side formed a sort of trough. Turn and strain as he would Tom could
      not free himself from the burden which threatened to smother him.
      Moreover, the convulsive death throe had forcibly tightened the grip of
      the claws in the side of his knee, which felt as if in some horrible
      torturing machine of the Inquisition; and had he not been able at last to
      reach that paw with his left hand and pull it away from the wound he would
      have died under the agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he felt the blood running hot and copious down his leg, a new
      fear chilled his heart. Might he not bleed to death? There seemed no end
      to the hemorrhage, and what hope had he of succor? He thought of firing
      signals of distress, but could not reach the pistol, which had been
      knocked out of his hand. He spoke to the dog, which was barking and
      worrying at the bear's hind leg, and Shep came and licked his face and
      sniffed at his blood-soaked trousers. Then, as if even he realized how
      hopeless was the situation, he sat on his haunches and howled until Tom,
      hearing him less and less distinctly, imagined himself a boulder slowly
      but musically crunching to powder under the resistless advance of a
      glacier, and lost consciousness as the cold-blue dream-ice closed over his
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he awoke. It was dark, and something cold and soft was blowing
      against his face. He moved and felt the shaggy fur and the horrible pain
      in his leg and in his right arm, which was confined in a twisted position.
      Then he remembered, but forgot again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second time he awoke. It was still dark, but a strange pallor permeated
      the air, and all around him was a mist of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was snowing fast. He closed his left hand and grasped a whole fistful
      of flakes. The body of the bear was a mound of white&mdash;like a new-made
      grave over him, he dismally thought. The snow had drifted under and about
      his shoulders. Its chill struck the wound in his thigh, which throbbed as
      though hit with pointed hammers, keeping time to the pulsations of his
      heart; but, thank God! he no longer felt that horrible warm trickling down
      his leg. He had been preserved from bleeding to freeze to death. How long
      before that would happen; or, if it were not cold enough for that, how
      long before the snow would drift clear over him and cut off the little
      breath which that ponderous, inert, dead-cold beast on his chest prevented
      from entering his lungs? Where was the dog? He called feebly: &ldquo;Shep! Shep!
      Hi-i-i, Sh-e-p!&rdquo; But no moist nose or rough tongue responded. He tried to
      whistle, but his parched mouth refused. Heavens, how thirsty! He stretched
      out his hand and gathered the snow within his reach. Then he closed his
      eyes and dreamed that two giants were pulling him asunder, and that a
      third was pouring molten lead down his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only Bill Cooper trying to make him drink whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood it after a little and realized that he ought to swallow.
      Then life came back, and with the knowledge that he was no longer alone on
      the cold, remote, relentless mountain top, but that Cooper was lifting
      away the bear, and that Shep was wild with sympathy and gladness because
      he had been able to bring help, came courage and forbearance of his
      suffering. In the morning new strength came with the sunshine. The snow
      rapidly melted. Cooper got breakfast and Tom rebandaged his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gashes won't amount to much, unless the claws were poisoned. You'll
      have to make me a crutch, and give me a couple of days to get rid of the
      stiffness, but then I'll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you and the bear get into this scrimmage, anyhow? You surely
      didn't go hunting him with that there six shooter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I. The wind was blowing hard toward me, so he didn't smell nor hear
      me, and I ran right on to him. Shep was not there to warn me, but if he
      hadn't come back just as he did, or if I hadn't been able to get at my
      revolver, Old Ephraim would ha' used me up in about a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't a betting on one pistol shot against a grizzly, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the chances were about one in a thousand, but I wasn't going
      to die without a shot. I suppose the bullet struck the lower part of the
      brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bill, who had been probing its track. &ldquo;Tore it all to pieces.
      But what was the bear after in that brush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up&mdash;ants, likely. You know&mdash;Great Scott! What's that
      dog got now?&rdquo; Shep was coming out of the bushes, dragging a package
      wrapped in buckskin which was almost too heavy for him to handle. Cooper
      went and took it from him and brought it to the fire. It was a sort of
      pouch firmly tied with a thong. Running a knife under this the bundle fell
      apart, and a double handful of flakes and nuggets of gold and quartz
      rolled out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cache!&rdquo; Tom shouted, comprehending instantly the meaning of this.
      &ldquo;The bear was tearing it to pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. His strong feet had displaced the loosely-heaped stones, and
      a half-devoured side of bacon lay close by where the animal had been
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the marauder had just begun his work. There remained in the
      cache two more pouches of gold&mdash;perhaps a quart of the metal pieces
      in all, more or less pure, for all of it had been dug out of a vein with
      hammer and knife point, none of the fragments showing the water-worn
      roundness characteristic of placer gold. Then there were a small quantity
      of provisions, some ammunition and a small rosewood box with an ornamental
      brass lock having a remarkably small and irregular keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an inner pocket of his purse Tom drew the odd little key the dead
      prospector had given him. It fitted into the hole and easily turned the
      lock. The cover sprang open, revealing a package of letters. He lifted
      them out, but did not pause to read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came an envelope containing a patent to ranch lands in Arizona,
      certificates of stock in Mexican and other mines that Burke had never
      heard of, and a commission as lieutenant of artillery in the Confederate
      army. All these documents were made out to &ldquo;Arthur F. Pierson,&rdquo;
       establishing the fact that the lost hat was really that worn by the old
      man, as his dog had recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the box, however, Tom found what interested him most&mdash;a
      formal &ldquo;claim&rdquo; and description of the lode whence the gold had been taken,
      and how to reach it from this cache. It was written in pencil, in a very
      shaky hand, on two or three soiled leaves torn from a memorandum book and
      eked out with one of the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom took up the letters. Most of them were recent and of business
      importance, but several were old and worn with much handling. One of these
      latter was from a lawyer in San Francisco, acknowledging funds &ldquo;sent for
      the support of your infant daughter,&rdquo; describing her health and growth,
      and the care taken of her &ldquo;at the convent&rdquo;&mdash;all in curt business
      phrase, but precious to the father's heart. Then there were two or three
      small letters, printed and scratched in a childish hand, to &ldquo;dear, dear
      papa,&rdquo; and signed &ldquo;Your little Polly.&rdquo; One of these spoke of Sister Agatha
      and Sister Theresa, showing that it was written while the child was still
      in the convent; but the others, a little later, prattled about a new home
      with &ldquo;my new papa and mamma,&rdquo; but gave no clew to name or place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This baby girl&mdash;she must be a young woman now, if she lives,&rdquo; Tom
      mused&mdash;&ldquo;is evidently the person the poor old chap wanted me to divide
      with. It ought not to be difficult to trace her from San Francisco, I
      suppose the convent Sisters knew where she went to when they gave her up.
      But, hello! here's a picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an old-fashioned daguerrotype of a handsome woman of perhaps
      four-and-twenty, in bridal finery, whose face seemed to him to have
      something familiar in its expression. But no name or date was to be found,
      and with the natural conclusion that this was probably Pierson's wife he
      puzzled a moment more over the pretty face, and then put it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few days, when Burke was able to travel, the prospector's
      memorandum and their mountain craft together led them almost directly to
      the coveted gold vein, which ran across a shoulder of the mountain at the
      head of the gulch, like an obscure trail, finally disappearing under a
      great talus at the foot of a line of snowcapped crags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracing it along, they presently came upon the old man's claim marks. The
      stakes were lettered pathetically with the name of the old man's choosing&mdash;&ldquo;Polly's
      Hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adjoining the &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; Tom staked out one claim for himself and another for
      his sweetheart, intending to do the proper assessment work on it himself
      if Corbitt couldn't or wouldn't; and Cooper used up most of what remained
      of the visible outcrop in a claim for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to town their claims were registered in the Crimson Mineral
      District, and their report sent a flight of gold hunters in hot haste to
      the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Burke, after selling everything he could send to market to turn into
      ready money, departed to Denver, carrying with him documents and specimens
      of the gold quartz to support his assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keen men fêted and flattered him, buttonholing him at every corner with
      whispered advice, and many proffered schemes. But he was indifferent to it
      all, and anxious as yet only to hear what Marion should say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word had he heard from her directly during all the weeks of her
      absence, but indirectly he knew she had been a star in the local society.
      He had even to hunt out where she lived, finding it in a cottage near
      where the stately court house now stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went there, after tea, with a fastbeating heart. Had she forgotten, or
      withdrawn or been turned away by hardhearted parents and friends? He
      suspected everything and everybody, yet could give no reasons. And how
      absurd these fears looked to him&mdash;how <i>foolish!</i>&mdash;when,
      sitting in the little parlor, hand in hand, they talked over the past, and
      she confided that the same doubts had worried her now and then&mdash;&ldquo;most
      of all, Tom, dear, when I hear of this wonderful success of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! I had forgotten it. By your side all else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the door opened&mdash;not too abruptly&mdash;and Mr. Corbitt came in,
      grimly hospitable and glad, no doubt for his own sake, to see this young
      fellow who was still true to his daughter; while Mrs. Corbitt was more
      openly cordial, as became her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' what's this we're hearin' aboot your new mines? They're sayin' down
      town that you've struck a regular bonanza, an'll soon be worth your
      meellions. But I told 'em 'Hoot! I'd heard the like o' that before!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Tom recounted briefly the story of the prospector's death and his will;
      still more briefly his adventure with the grizzly, and how it led to the
      curious disclosure of the cache. Then, with no little dramatic force,
      seeing how interested was his audience, he described the hunt for the vein
      and the finding it, produced his specimens and handed to Miss Marion a
      mass of almost solid gold embedded in its matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't promise you,&rdquo; he said, as she tried to thank him with her eyes
      and a timid touch of her fingers, &ldquo;that the whole ledge will equal that,
      but it is a genuine sample from near the surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo; the old Scotchman ejaculated, with gleaming eyes,
      as Tom went on to show how regular and secure was the title to this
      possession. &ldquo;But did ye no find out the name of the poor vagabone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Didn't I mention it? His name was Arthur Pierson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corbitt and his wife both started from their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, did I hear ye aright?&mdash;<i>Arthur F. Pierson?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the name exactly. I can show it to you on the letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he charged ye to give the half of all ye found to his daughter
      Polly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I mean to try to find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>There she sits!</i>&rdquo; cried Mother Corbitt excitedly, before her
      cautious husband, could say &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;&mdash;pointing at Marion, who gazed
      from one to the other, too much amazed to feel grieved yet at this
      stunning announcement. &ldquo;We took the lassie when she was a wee bairn, and
      she would never ha' known she wasn't ours really till maybe we were dead
      and gone. Her feyther was a cankert, fashious body, but her mother was
      guid and bonnie (I knew her well in the auld country) and she died when
      Mary&mdash;that's you, my dearie&mdash;was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this her picture?&rdquo; Tom asked, showing the daguerrotype.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that it is. Puir Jennie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest is soon told. A company of capitalists was formed to work the
      four consolidated claims on the new vein, under the name of the Hope
      Mining Company.

      All the next season was spent by Tom Burke in developing the property and
      erecting machinery. Corbitt was there too, much thawed by the sun of
      prosperity, but his wife and daughter remained in Denver. In the autumn,
      however, the ladies went East, and as the holidays approached Tom and
      Corbitt followed them to New York, where, on Christmas eve, my hero and
      heroine were married quietly in a little church up town; and his gift to
      her was the brooch which had attracted my attention and whose significance
      was now plain.

    <h2>
      MISS GWYNNE'S BURGLAR, By Violet Etynge Mitchell
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the heart of
      Wales, nestling between two dark frowning mountains, and lulled to drowsy
      indifference of the big outside world by the murmurs of the not far
      distant sea, stands the little village of Cod-y-glyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just outside the village, on the main road stands&mdash;or did stand ten
      years ago&mdash;an old stone house, in the middle of a large garden, which
      was surrounded on all sides by a high wall, also of stone. It was the
      pride of the owner, Miss Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, in the early spring of the year, there was to be a wedding at
      Cod-y-Glyn&mdash;a wedding in humble life, but anticipated with great glee
      by the invited guests, among whom were Miss Gwynne's servants, the
      coachman and his wife (who was also cook) and Ylva, their daughter,
      employed as a maid-of-all-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing the disappointment it would be to them if they were denied the
      pleasure of attending the wedding, she had declined the coachman's offer
      to remain with her, allowing his wife and daughter to go, and laughingly
      assured him that with her father's gun for company she feared nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gwynne retired at an early hour, having locked up the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay for some time gazing through the window at the twinkling stars,
      lost in quiet retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will let Miss Gwynne tell the rest of the story in her own way,
      repeating as well as I can from memory the words as I heard them from her
      lips ten years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot tell if I dozed or not, but I was conscious of the moon shining
      dimly through the clouds, and I wondered how long I had lain there.
      Reaching out for my watch, which lay on the table, I was horrified to feel
      my wrist grasped and held by a firm hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say I was frightened would be less correct than to say I was astounded,
      for I have always been a woman of steady nerve, and the present occasion
      called for its use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had retired behind a heavy curtain of clouds, and the room was in
      complete darkness, but from the drapery at my bedside issued a voice, and
      at the same time the python-like grasp on my wrist relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg to apologize, madam,&rdquo; said this voice; &ldquo;I have chosen a bungling
      manner of awakening you&mdash;foreign to my custom. Pardon me, and do not
      be alarmed. I merely wish to relieve you of any superfluous silver,
      jewelry or bank notes you do not absolutely need. But as the vandalism of
      breaking locks is out of my line, I will request you to arise and show me
      where such things are kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had finished this speech I was myself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I'll get up and show you; but, as it is embarrassing
      to dress in your presence, will you step out into the hall and close the
      door while I put on my clothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a soft rustling of the curtains at the bedside, and the sound of
      footsteps on the carpet, and immediately afterward the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes, madam, is all I can give you,&rdquo; remarked the burglar, as he
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me (after lighting the candle) two minutes to slip on a warm
      skirt, and a blue flannel wrapper over it; then, sticking my feet into a
      pair of down slippers, I had still time to snatch a roll of bills
      amounting to one hundred pounds, and pin them deftly to the lining of the
      canopy above my four-post bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then throwing open the door I stood on the sill facing my visitor, and
      threw the glare of the lighted candle full upon him, as he lolled in a
      careless, easy attitude against the bannisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been prepared for a burglar&mdash;but I had looked for one attired
      according to the traditions of my ancestors. But here was a gentlemanly,
      mild-featured individual, such as I should have expected to find filling
      the position of a professor of Latin&mdash;perhaps of theology&mdash;in
      Oxford University.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no appearance of a jimmy, or tools of any kind. Evidently here
      was a type of criminal with which history was unacquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; he exclaimed, bowing with the grace of a French courtier, &ldquo;you
      are punctuality itself. And how charming!&mdash;no hysterics&mdash;no
      distressing scenes. Allow me.&rdquo; He took the candle from my hand, and
      holding it aloft preceded me down the great oaken stairs, talking fluently
      all the while, but pausing at every other step to glance over his shoulder
      at me with coquettish politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to assure you,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that I am no ordinary house-breaker.
      Burglary is with me a <i>profession</i>, though not the one (I confess)
      chosen for me by my parents. I saw, at an early age, that I must either
      descend to the level of the burglar, or raise him to the level of an
      artist. Behold, my dear lady, the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the foot of the stairs and looked up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we proceed to the diningroom?&rdquo; he asked airily; &ldquo;and, as I wish to
      give you no unnecessary trouble, let me say that I do not dabble in <i>plated</i>
      spoons; nothing but solid silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the old mahogany sideboard, in which Griffiths had, for years,
      placed the family heirlooms at night, and beheld my gentlemanly burglar
      stow them, one after another, in a capacious felt sack, which he carried
      in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am a connoisseur, I assure you, and I know silver
      from plate. These articles are really worth the risk of the enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You ask me if I was not alarmed. No, I was <i>not</i>. Personal violence
      was not in his professional line, unless opposed. I summoned all my
      energies to outwit him. I thought much and said little, for I had no
      intention of allowing him to carry off my mother's silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having rifled all the rooms of the most valuable articles, he
      returned to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table the remains of supper still stood, consisting of a fowl,
      hardly touched, some delicately cut bread and butter, cake, and a glass
      jar containing some fancy crackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make myself entirely at home,&rdquo; he remarked, sitting down to the
      table, and helping himself to a wing of the chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;I have thoroughly enjoyed this evening. Not only
      have I met a most charming lady, but I have been able to prove to her that
      the terms gentleman and burglar may be synonomous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He now began on the cake. I pushed the cracker jar toward him. &ldquo;Try them,&rdquo;
       I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still smiling indulgently, and talking, he took out one of the crackers
      and began to nibble on it. It was <i>very dry</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose, and in an absent-minded manner placed on the table the remains of
      a bottle of rare old Burgundy, which had been opened the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, really,&rdquo; he prattled, &ldquo;I'm a very harmless man five months out of
      six&mdash;I never steal unless other means fail, or a tailor's bill comes
      due. I'm a respectable citizen and&mdash;a church member in good standing
      when I'm not on one of my professional tours. I took up burglary more as a
      resource than from necessity. Candidly speaking, now, <i>am</i> I a
      ruffian?&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I replied, looking directly at him. &ldquo;On the contrary, you are a very
      fine-looking man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glow of vanity spread over his face. I poured out a glass of the
      Burgundy and pushed it toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England to Wales!&rdquo; he cried with gallantry. &ldquo;I don't generally drink,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;but these crackers make me thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only find a wife suited to my tastes,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;such a woman
      as <i>you</i> are, by George! I'd give up aesthetic burglary and settle
      down to quiet domestic bliss.&rdquo; He looked questioningly at me. &ldquo;If&rdquo;&mdash;he
      hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;you could be sure I would abandon my profession&mdash;would
      you&mdash;do you think you could&mdash;condone my past and&mdash;marry
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter for consideration,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped himself to another cracker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your proposal is so startlingly unique,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;to marry one's
      burglar! Really it is quite a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it?&rdquo; he chuckled, evidently enjoying the idea of the oddity. &ldquo;We
      are kindred spirits!&rdquo; he exclaimed, convivially, but was interrupted by a
      violent fit of coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seizing the bottle of Burgundy, he drained the only drop or two left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, maybe, there's another bottle down in the cellar,&rdquo; I cried,
      artlessly. &ldquo;I'll go down and see&mdash;I feel thirsty myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will descend together,&rdquo; exclaimed my burglar, gallantly taking the
      candle from my hand and following me to the door leading to the cellar
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We descended the steps chatting pleasantly&mdash;he discoursing on
      matrimony, I answering rather vaguely, but measuring the distance to the
      wine bins by my eye. They were at the far end of the cellar, and were five
      in number, each large enough to hold a quarter of a ton of coal. Before
      the furthest one I paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0059" id="linkimage-0059"> </a>

    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0300.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is the brand we are looking for.&rdquo; I raised the heavy lid
      and looked in. &ldquo;I will hold the candle,&rdquo; I observed; &ldquo;will you get the
      bottle? I can hardly reach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed me the candle and bent low over the bin. Ha! ha! Quicker than a
      flash of lightning I tipped up his heels (he was easily overbalanced), and
      into the bin he fell headlong. Down came the heavy lid. But there was no
      padlock on it. I must hurry! Blowing out the candle, I ran, for I knew the
      way, straight to the cellar steps and up them&mdash;like a cat. Then with
      a locked door between myself and my burglar, I could breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the man kicking about down below, for of course he got out of the
      bin at once. But our cellar is a labyrinth. Seizing father's old gun from
      its resting-place in the hall, I sat down near the door at the head of the
      stairs, waiting for the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was fairly strong&mdash;that I knew; but he was a powerful man.
      So I dragged a heavy table from the sitting-room and placed it against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I became conscious that he had found his way to the stairs and
      was rapidly approaching the door, which was all that lay between me and
      his revengeful fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bracing myself against the opposite wall, I raised the old gun, and,
      deliberately aiming it, waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by pounding with both fists on the door, but, not receiving any
      answer, he tried threats. An instinct seemed to tell him I would remain on
      guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      His language, I must confess, while threatening, was not abusive. It was,
      in fact, incredibly elegant for a burglar, and strictly grammatical.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once there came a crash, followed by the creaking of heavy timber,
      and the door fell. Down he came on top of it, sprawling at my feet on the
      floor. I raised my gun and fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit him?&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Miss Gwynne; &ldquo;here in the wall of the dining-room the bullet
      lodged, and is still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I was conscious of was Mrs. Griffiths bending over me, and
      her husband's voice exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd never have escaped if we had not left that door open when we came
      in. You see we got home just in time to hear you fire the gun, and as we
      ran in he ran out. Drat him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself on my elbow and looked eagerly about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had no time to carry off a thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Griffiths.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to set my eyes on him,&rdquo; I remarked, when Miss Gwynne had
      concluded her story. &ldquo;You are a distinguished woman and are&mdash;I
      believe&mdash;the very first one who ever received an offer of marriage
      from a burglar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady smiled. &ldquo;Do you not remember reading about the capture of a
      notorious bank robber, several years ago? The case created quite a
      sensation, owing partly to the difficulty in tracing the thief, who was
      clever enough to puzzle the most expert detectives and evade the police,
      and also to the respectability of his position. No one could believe him
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do remember it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Not only that, but I <i>saw</i>
      the man after he was in prison. I happened to be going through Chester
      Jail at the time and J&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was pointed out to me. He was
      quite distinguished looking. In fact, I did not believe him guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would I,&rdquo; said Miss Gwynne, &ldquo;if I had not known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that he&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you saw <i>my burglar</i>.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; in a hearty, pleasant voice, &ldquo;maybe you are the better judge; but
      I don't believe she's 'made up,' and if I wasn't the most henpecked man on
      earth I'd say she was the loveliest creature I ever saw. As for her hair,
      it's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blondined! And so utterly impossible in color that it couldn't for a
      moment fool anybody but a man,&rdquo; interrupted the first speaker, with
      deliciously spiteful emphasis on the very common noun man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyebrows stencilled, eyelashes darkened; lips, ears and finger tips
      tinged with carmine&mdash;don't you know? Complexion enamel, vinegar rouge
      and brunette powder&mdash;pshaw! The way the men go on about her makes me
      positively ill. If you fall in love with her, Harry, you are no brother of
      mine. I don't care to be sister-in-law to a lithograph in <i>fast</i>
      colors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me curious to see her, Nell, dear. By Jove, she must be either a
      monster or a paragon! Have the spirit of a man, Tom, and tell me which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to extract any more information from me, old man; my teeth are
      positively chattering with terror. You can decide for yourself this
      evening, if your ferocious sister will allow you to leave your room. By
      the way,&rdquo; with an amused laugh, &ldquo;what do you suppose Nell and the rest of
      her charitable sex up here have dubbed the poor girl? 'The lady in
      rouge!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and she ought to have a sign, 'Paint, don't touch.' I believe she is
      a divorcée or a widow, and I know she's thirty in spite of her sickening
      affectation of youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Nell, you are absolutely vicious. She is not a day over twenty,
      and she has the prettiest name I ever heard, Violante Solander; accent on
      the second syllable, Harry, not on the first, to rhyme with Hollander, as
      the bride of my bosom insists on pronouncing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like a combination of Spanish and Scandinavian,&rdquo; the younger man
      answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; returns his brother-in-law. &ldquo;I have met her father several times
      at the Cosmos Club in Washington. He is a Norwegian, a wonderfully
      handsome man, of the purest blonde type, with charming old-time manners
      and a voice as deep and sonorous as a fine bell. Jack Kendricks, who knows
      him quite well, told me something of his history. As a young man he
      traveled pretty much all over the world, and in South America met and
      married Miss Viola's mother. She was an Ecuadorean of Spanish descent, and
      so beautiful that she was called, in reference to her name, which was the
      same as her daughter's, 'The Violet of Quito.' It is really a case of the
      Arctic zone wedding the Equator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or of a walrus committing matrimony with a llama. No wonder she is
      neither fish, flesh nor fowl,&rdquo; added madame, with a malicious emphasis
      that made both men laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation floated up to me as I sat smoking my cigar on the
      forward edge of the hurricane deck of the little steamer that carried
      passengers from the railroad station at the foot of a beautiful and
      well-known lake in the Adirondacks to the village at the head of it,
      whither we were all bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party of three had crossed from the other side of the boat and Were
      leaning against the guards immediately under me. Later on I came to know
      them all well. The lady was a delightful little bundle of inconsistencies,
      sharp of tongue, quick of temper and jealous of all that belonged to her,
      but as generous as an Arab, very warm hearted, perfectly fearless and
      honest and a loyal friend when won. She was born Miss Eleanor Van Zandt, a
      family with a tree and traditions, pride, possessions and position; but
      the fact that she belonged in the top layer of the Four Hundred did not
      prevent her, some ten years before, refusing a scion of the English
      nobility (a very wealthy one, too, if you'll believe me), to her mother's
      Infinite disgust, and giving her dimpled little hand, where she had
      already given her heart, to big, kindly, genial Thomas Northrup, who was
      every inch a man and a gentleman, but who was third in direct descent (and
      gloried in it, too) from old John Northrup, saddle and harness maker, of
      whom I have heard it told by one that saw it that he died on his sixtieth
      birthday in the battle of Gettysburg, from some twenty bullet wounds
      received while carrying the colors of his regiment, and that his last
      words were: &ldquo;Don't let the Johnnies get the flag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I feel it to be my painful duty to relate that Madame Nell, when
      remonstrated with by her family upon the plebeian nature of the match she
      was about to make, flew into a violent rage and said she would gladly
      trade a baker's dozen of her eminently high and wellborn Knickerbocker
      ancestors for &ldquo;that grand old saddler.&rdquo; The Van Zandt crest is a lion
      rampant gardant, and shortly after the wedding an aunt, who had declined
      to be present, received a spirited sketch of the family beast, leaning
      upon a musket in the position of parade rest, carrying a flag in his mouth
      and bearing upon his lordly back a monstrous saddle, the motto in the
      surrounding heraldic belt being, &ldquo;Don't let the Johnnies get the flag!&rdquo;
       This cheerful device was accompanied by a very deferential and
      affectionate note from the bride, asking her aunt if she did not think it
      a pretty way of combining the Northrup family (saddle) tree with the crest
      of the Van Zandts, or if she thought the &ldquo;dear old lion&rdquo; would appear to
      better advantage under a saddle that would conceal him entirely from the
      gaze of the vulgar herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady declined to receive Mrs. Northrup from that time until the
      day of her death, about four years later, but when her will was opened it
      was found that she had left $200,000 to her niece, Eleanor Van Zandt, &ldquo;as
      a mark of respect for her truth, courage and <i>artistic ability</i>,&rdquo; and
      $10,000 for a monument &ldquo;to that gallant soldier and true gentleman, John
      Northrup, who died on the field of Gettysburg in the defense of his
      country's flag.&rdquo; Nell designed the monument, and every Decoration Day she
      puts a saddle made of flowers on the old lady's grave. But to my tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Van Zandt, at the time of which I write, was about twenty-six, tall,
      broad shouldered, athletic, brown as to eyes, hair, skin and pointed
      beard, an engineer and architect by profession, an advanced and liberal
      thinker for so young a man, full of high spirits, though with a depth and
      earnestness of purpose very refreshing in these days when selfish
      indifference is the rule, and altogether a manly, honorable, self reliant
      and energetic young fellow. He had charming manners, reverenced all women,
      rich or poor, proud or humble, and treated old people with an affectionate
      deference that won him many friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer had changed her course to the left rather sharply, heading for
      her wharf, when a Long Lake boat, with a woman at the sculls and a young
      man holding the tiller ropes, crossed our bow and floated by within
      fifteen feet of us. I did not need the quick, &ldquo;There she is! Look, Harry!&rdquo;
       from Mr. Northrup to know that it was Miss Solander. She had turned her
      head slightly toward them to bow, and the setting sun shone squarely in
      her face, making the wonderful amber hair seem a nimbus of golden light
      against the dark background of her huge Gainsborough hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more perfectly, harmoniously, radiantly beautiful girl I have never
      seen. Her coloring was simply marvelous, and I inclined to Mrs. Northrup's
      opinion that it must be artificial. It is impossible to give an adequate
      description of her&mdash;the wonderful child-woman. A face of rounded and
      exquisite contours, the skin of that warmest, richest, brunette type that
      is almost dusky; cheeks that had the soft, tender, velvety bloom of a
      sun-kissed peach; a charming mouth, scarlet as a flower, ripe, luscious,
      sensitive, ready to curve with sweet, swift laughter or to droop with
      grief. Her eyes, in the glimpse I had of her, I took to be black or a very
      dark brown, but later I found they were of that rare deep blue that
      becomes violet by an artificial light, and, indeed, owing to the length
      and thickness of the dark lashes, it was not easy at any time to determine
      their exact color, much less shade. Well, she was more nearly perfect than
      any other human thing I ever hope to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From her gold-flax curls' most marvelous shine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Down to her lithe and delicate feet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was not a curve nor a waving line
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But moved in a harmony firm and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As she passed from view I looked down at the trio below me. Mrs. Northrup
      was regarding her brother curiously, and I don't think either she or I was
      at all surprised when he turned, his face aglow with enthusiasm, and said:
      &ldquo;What a lovely girl!&rdquo; Then, with quick change of tone, &ldquo;Who is that man
      with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely as a Prang,&rdquo; remarked my lady, dryly. &ldquo;The man is your hated
      rival, of whom you are already madly jealous. He is young, beautiful and
      rich, dances divinely, speaks <i>real</i> English and has very nearly a
      tablespoonful of brains&mdash;not that he needs such a preponderance of
      brain, for he has enough money to make a social success of a jibbering
      idiot. His name is Francis Floyd-Jones, but we speak of him affectionately
      as 'Fluggeon,' and those that know him best sometimes lovingly refer to
      him as 'Balaam's Ass'&mdash;but you'll like him, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Van Zandt's reply I did not hear, as I discreetly moved away; but I heard
      both men laugh, and I joined them heartily when at a safe distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we landed I found we were all bound for the same hotel, a capital
      one, named for and kept by one of a famous hotel-keeping family. The
      Northrups' little girl, a madcap child of six, was on the lawn waiting the
      return of her parents and the arrival of her uncle, of whom she was
      evidently very fond, although she abandoned him speedily in order to hug
      and kiss his superb Irish setter, Blarney, who licked the small imp's face
      calmly and appeared in his grave dog's way genuinely glad to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, as I found out in a day or two, had taken one of those intense
      fancies that children do occasionally to almost entire strangers to &ldquo;the
      lady in rouge,&rdquo; and would escape to her whenever chance permitted. Poor
      Mrs. Northrup! Her ranks were deserters to the enemy. Her husband openly
      admired the gorgeously-tinted girl, her child simply worshipped her, her
      brother had palpably fallen in love at first sight, and, when we came out
      from dinner, it was found that Blarney had dumbly sworn allegiance to the
      violet of two zones and could with difficulty be induced to leave her. The
      dog's infatuation was put to-practical service by his master during the
      next few weeks, for that astute young gentleman, when unable to discover
      the whereabouts of his idol by peering and prowling, would take one of
      Blarney's silky ears in his hand and whisper, &ldquo;Go, find her, boy,&rdquo; which
      the clever animal promptly proceeded to do, usually successfully, though
      often the search would receive a check on the edge of the lake and be
      resumed after a run of a mile on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Nell and I soon discovered that we had a host of common friends in
      New York and Washington, and that an uncle on her mother's side (poor Dick
      Whitney, who was lost on the <i>Ville de Havre</i>) had been a classmate
      of mine at Harvard forty odd years before. These kindly young people were
      as good and affectionate to me as though I had been a relative, and the
      heart of a lonely old man went out to them gratefully and lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, I am tempted to repeat a compliment that I overheard toward
      the end of the summer, because it was the pleasantest and heartiest I ever
      had paid to me, or rather about me. Charge it to the garrulity of age or
      simple conceit, but here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      I came up behind them one dark night on the piazza, just as Mrs. Northrop
      turned to her husband and said: &ldquo;Do you know, Tom, dear, I think Dr. Zobel
      is the very nicest old man I ever knew; he has the head of a sage and the
      fresh, pure heart of a little child.&rdquo;

    <p>
      There was a hop that first evening in the large drawing room of the hotel,
      and a little while before the music began I wandered in to find three or
      four small groups talking and laughing, among them Van Zandt and his
      sister. She made room for me on the sofa, and said I should be her
      attendant cavalier, as she did not intend to dance. We chatted a bit and
      then madame began a running commentary on the people as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Robinsons&mdash;papa, mamma and daughter. Papa looketh upon the wine
      when it is red. Mamma is a devout Catholic. Daughter openly defies both
      parents and, I am convinced, hath a devil. I have ventured to rename them
      'Rum, Romanism and Rebellion.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What De Quincy would call 'an overt act of alliteration,' Nell,&rdquo; said Van
      Zandt, and added: &ldquo;Who is the imposing-looking old girl leading the small,
      meek man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Oh! of course. The lion and the lamb. Mrs. Colter is literary,
      writes things, reads Browning understanding (happy woman!), quotes Greek
      to people that never harmed her, and herds the lamb, who never has any
      capers in his sauce, and who is, I am told, her third matrimonial
      venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fulfillness of prophecy,&rdquo; murmured Harry, &ldquo;'And the lion and the lamb
      shall lie down together.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, you are incorrigible. The young man of peculiarly unwholesome
      appearance who has just sneaked in is, I am morally certain, Uriah Heep,
      though he says his name is Penrose. That [as a handsome old lady of large
      proportions came into the room] is Miss Eldridge. She is very nice, but is
      omnipresent, so we call her 'The Almighty,' Her escort is Mr. Hinton; he
      is the biggest, jolliest and&mdash;except my Tom&mdash;the bestnatured man
      here. Everyone calls him 'Jumbo' or 'Billy' Look out for him, Buz; he is
      another rival and determined to have the chromo at any price. There she is
      with 'Buttons' in tow, and the disconsolate 'Wafer' vainly endeavoring to
      console himself with his divinity's aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentlemen were aptly named. The first, a handsome young West
      Pointer on furlough, in all the glory of cadet gray and a multitude of
      bell buttons; the other, a pleasant-faced fellow, surprisingly tall and
      thin. Nell had introduced Van Zandt and me to Miss Solander and her aunt
      shortly after dinner, and I had had a very pleasant chat with the stately,
      whitehaired old lady, who was so proud and fond of her exquisite niece.
      She was Mr. Solander's sister and the widow of Captain Dupont of the
      French Navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several friends of Mrs. Northrup joined her, and Van Zandt excused himself
      and went to make one of the little group of men around Miss Solander,
      followed by a parting injunction from his sister to remember that benzine
      would remove paint spots if applied while they were fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful as this flower-faced girl was at all times, by lamp light and in
      evening dress she was lovely beyond all power of words to express, and as
      I came to know her I found that her beauty was not alone in her superb
      coloring, in the perfect lines of her face and figure or in her exuberant
      health, but was in her life; for she was&mdash;and is&mdash;that rare,
      sweet thing, a womanly woman, brave, strong, gentle, generous, pure of
      heart and clean of thought, a lover of truth, a hater of meanness, with a
      mind broadened by travel and burnished by attrition; and she carried,
      moreover, a cloak of charity of such wide and ample fold that it fell
      lovingly over even the follies and frailties of those weaker ones of her
      own sex and was proof against the arrows of envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With old people and children she was a great favorite; the men were her
      enthusiastic admirers, and a good half dozen of them were helplessly,
      hopelessly, over head and ears in love with her; but a number of the young
      married women and girls professed strong disapproval of her, on similar
      grounds to those outlined by Mrs. Northrup on the steamer, though I had my
      private suspicions that, in some cases at least, they were a trifle
      jealous of the attention she received from the men, who, as is generally
      the case at summer resorts, were not overabundant. Mrs. Northrup's dislike
      was an honest one, for she firmly believed the girl was artificial, and
      having carefully avoided an intimacy knew but little of the lovely nature
      and bright mind that no one was better fitted to appreciated than she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, Madame Nell was a born matchmaker and wanted her adored brother
      to marry her particular friend and crony, Miss Carrie Belmont, a
      brighteyed, keen-witted, merry little soul, who took nothing seriously
      except medicine and had about as much fixedness of purpose as a month-old
      kitten. To a man like Van Zandt, who needed both the curb and spur of a
      mentality as strong and earnest as his own, she would have been about as
      valuable a helpmeet as was poor little Dora to David Copperfield. But Nell
      was fond of the pretty, clever little creature, felt sure (as our mothers
      and sisters, God bless 'em! always do) that her brother was thoroughly
      incapable of picking out the right kind of a wife, and weeks before he
      came had perceived in Miss Solander's marvelous loveliness a dangerous and
      powerful factor in the personal equations she wished to make equal to each
      other, so that by the transposition of matrimony they should become one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this knowledge came to me gradually; but even that first
      evening, as Van Zandt and Miss Solander passed near us in the waltz, I
      could see that he was wonderfully taken with his fair partner. For the
      next few days he was more or less the victim of some little sisterly traps
      that were set with great tact and amused Northrup and me immensely. Then
      my young gentleman escaped and made great running, distancing &ldquo;Buttons,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;The Wafer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Balaam's Ass,&rdquo; and the rest of what Nell called the &ldquo;fry,&rdquo;
       and crowding Hinton closely for what each felt was his life's race for a
      prize that might be for neither of them. They were a nice, manly, generous
      pair of rivals, and I never saw either take an unfair advantage of the
      other. I remember one day I was fishing, when they both rushed down to
      their boats and started for the island at racing stroke. Just as they were
      abreast of me Van Zandt, who was leading, broke a rowlock, and Hinton
      forged ahead; but the moment he saw what had occurred he backed water,
      tossed Harry an extra rowlock, waited until he had put it in, and then
      away they went again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was the favored one it was for some time difficult to decide, as the
      girl was evidently used to a great deal of attention, and accepted it
      gracefully and even gratefully; but yet somehow as though it was a matter
      of course. She took many things as matters of course, by the way, among
      others her beauty, of which she was as little vain as a flower is of its
      color or perfume, and she labored under the pleasant delusion that men
      liked her simply because she could dance and ride and row and shoot and
      play tennis. There was another thing she played beside tennis, and that
      was the banjo, and it seemed to me that her rich, flexible contralto, the
      liquid tingle of the banjo and the Spanish words of the song she loved
      best to sing, made a harmony as soft and sweet as the fragrant, moonlit
      nights of her Southern home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until I read the generous and intelligent praise of the banjo by the
      gifted pen of America's greatest writer of romance, I had been rather
      diffident of expressing my liking for this charming instrument, partly
      because it was rather impressed upon me by my parents, who were a little
      tinged with Puritanism, that it was low, and partly because a musical
      friend, whose opinion in matters harmonic I always deferred to, disliked
      it; but, under the rose, I thought it delicious, and many years ago I used
      to wander pretty often to a beer garden in New York, where an old darky
      named Horace touched the strings with a master's hand and drew from them
      the half sad, half merry, but wholly sweet melodies of his child-hearted
      race, which always struck some responsive chord in me that no other music
      ever did.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of musical talent in the three hotels that summer.
      Miss Solander, Miss Belmont, Hinton and Van Zandt were a capital quartet;
      Mrs. Robinson was an accomplished pianist and accompanist; a young girl
      from Troy sang Irish songs to a zither delightfully; &ldquo;Buttons&rdquo; gave us the
      lays of West Point, and &ldquo;Balaam's Ass,&rdquo; as Mrs. Northrup expressed it,
      &ldquo;really brayed very melodiously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Van Zandt had one decided advantage over the other men in his wooing, for
      he had brought his own saddle horse with him, and as Miss Solander had
      hers, a beautiful and very fast bay mare, and was an enthusiastic
      horsewoman, riding nearly every day, wet or dry, he frequently managed to
      be her escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      They asked me to go with them one morning for a long ride through the
      mountains, and as it was not impossible that we might see a deer or some
      birds Miss Viola took her repeating shotgun, a pretty and close-shooting
      little weapon with which she was very expert, and Van Zandt and I our
      Stevens rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mount was the best to be had in the village, and was a strong, slow
      animal, intended by nature to grace a plow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a grand day, crisp and clear, and the first level stretch of road
      we came to my young companions decided to have a race. Away they went,
      Blarney and I at an increasing interval behind them. At a turn in the
      road, about a quarter of a mile ahead, Harry's big gray was leading the
      mare by a good length, and when they rejoined me Miss Solander
      acknowledged her defeat handsomely, but put in a saving clause for her pet
      by adding, &ldquo;She runs her best when frightened. I don't think even your
      splendid gray could catch her if we saw a bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry laughed pleasantly, said he imagined his horse, too, might develop
      unexpected speed under such circumstances, and we cantered on. A little
      before noon we left the main road and struck into a bridle path that led
      through a dense pine forest, utterly impassable by reason of fallen trees
      and underbush, except on the narrow trail. We had not gone far when our
      way seemed barred by a huge dead pine that had fallen slantingly across
      the path and rested on a great boulder on the other side. It was too high
      to jump near the roots without great danger and the triangular opening by
      the rock did not look high enough for a horse to go through. However, we
      dismounted and managed to get the animals through, though there was very
      little room to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about half a mile we came to the edge of the wood, and the trail
      widened out to ten or twelve feet, bordered by a dense second growth of
      ash. Perhaps a thousand yards farther on Blarney became excited over some
      fresh tracks in the sandy soil, which we found were those of a deer that
      had passed only a few minutes before, as was shown by a clump of fern that
      was slowly straightening its crushed and bent fronds by the side of the
      narrow road. Miss Solander and I halted, while Harry rode quietly on ahead
      after Blarney, who was acting rather queerly, I thought, following the
      deer track for a few feet, then pausing, with nose in the air and
      bristling back, to snuff the air and growl. Van Zandt spoke to him, and
      the dog went steadily and slowly forward. He was a clever beast and the
      only setter I ever saw that could hunt all kinds of game well. Miss
      Solander promptly emptied the magazine of her shotgun, and refilled it
      with wire cartridges loaded with &ldquo;buck and ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was watching Van Zandt, who was a few hundred feet away, when there was
      a crashing noise in the brush, and midway between him and us a good-sized
      black bear stepped out on the trail. My horse made a buck jump that nearly
      unseated me and backed half his length into the bush. Bang! Bang! went
      Miss Viola's gun. The bear stumbled, gave a roar of pain and rage, and
      started for us. The mare plunged wildly, wheeled about sharply and flew
      back by the way we came. The brute I rode was paralyzed with terror and I
      could not budge him, nor did I dare to shoot for fear of hitting Van
      Zandt, and my position of course kept his rifle silent. But he took in the
      situation at a glance, fired in the air, gave a yell that a panther might
      have envied, and came toward us at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0066" id="linkimage-0066"> </a>

      <a href="images/0326.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The bear turned to look at this new enemy, and rose promptly on his hind
      legs to receive him. I saw the gray swerve slightly, heard a savage &ldquo;Jump,
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; you!&rdquo; from Van Zandt, saw his spurs go home, and
      then the great horse rise to the leap and skim over the bear in a splendid
      arch. Blarney, who was just behind his master, was not so fortunate. He
      lit fairly on the bear, and was sadly scratched and bitten before he got
      away. Van Zandt shouted, &ldquo;I must catch her before she gets to the fallen
      tree!&rdquo; and went by me like a whirlwind. It was not much over a mile, she
      had a hundred yards and more the start of him, and the mare was going like
      the wind. I fired a shot as soon as the gray passed me, and the report
      seemed to rouse my horse, who, oblivious to spur and voice, had cowered
      shivering in the brush, for he shook himself, snorted, took a last look at
      the bear, which was preparing to join the procession, turned tail and
      fled, developing speed of which I would not have believed him capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a horrible ride, not on account of the bear, which might have been
      a mouse for all the thought I gave it, but because there, ahead of me, in
      that narrow road, a beautiful girl, just blossoming into splendid
      womanhood, was rushing to an awful, ghastly death, and a few cruel yards
      behind her the man that loved her and would so gladly have given his life
      for hers. Oh, how my heart ached for him, and how I wished the old man
      that was third in that terrible race might die instead of that sweet
      child-woman! Could he overtake her? He was spurring fiercely and the gray
      was doing his best; but though the gap between them was closing, it was
      closing slowly&mdash;and we had entered the wood. Yes, he was surely
      gaining now, sixty feet more and he would have her. But there was the
      tree, and he couldn't reach her in time. I covered my eyes with my hands
      and turned sick and faint. Then came back to me in a man's voice grown
      shrill with agony, one word, and following it crash! crash! in rapid
      succession, and again the sound of the hurrying hoof beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened my eyes. Was I blinded by my tears? There were no dreadful
      bundles under the tree. Then that word, with its fierce, imperious note of
      command, which had conveyed no meaning to me in that first awful moment,
      came through the porch of the outer ear, where it had lingered, into the
      brain, and I understood&mdash;&ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; He had taken the one chance left to
      them at the last moment, shrieked his order at her, and she had obeyed,
      lifting her mare to a leap that looked impossible. He had followed her,
      and they had cleared it safely, for I could see their heads over the
      fallen trunk. I checked my horse, dismounted, led him through the opening
      and galloped on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments I had the pleasure of seeing the gray range up alongside
      of the mare and Van Zandt seize her bridle. I joined them and found they
      were sound in life and limb. Harry was standing by the mare's head,
      quieting her, and somehow he had gotten possession of a little gauntleted
      hand and was looking at the girl with a world of love in his fine eyes.
      She was quite pale, but her face was steadfast and strong, and in it as
      she met Van Zandt's look frankly was the dawning of something that she was
      unaware of yet, something that, if she lived would crown her lover's life
      with happiness &ldquo;sweet beyond compare&rdquo;&mdash;and my old heart was glad for
      them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Blarney nor the bear was in sight, and as I had hung on to my
      rifle half unconsciously I proposed going back to look for the dog, but
      they insisted on accompanying me, and Miss Solander showed her own gun in
      its carbine holster with the flap buttoned. I tell you it took nerve for a
      girl on a runaway horse to do that bit of work. Well, we went cautiously
      back, Van Zandt holding a strap fastened to the mare's bridle, and I on
      ahead. Nothing in sight until we got out of the wood and had made a slight
      turn. Then we saw Blarney, very ragged and bloody, but with an air of
      proud ownership, sniffing around the dead body of the bear. We had some
      trouble in bringing up the horses, but managed it finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone seemed to feel after that that Van Zandt would win and wear the
      violet. Even Mrs. Northrup was preparing to bow gracefully to the
      inevitable, when Ethel came on the scene in the rôle of &ldquo;enfante terrible&rdquo;
       and spoke her little piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely summer afternoon. The next day, Monday, was Miss Viola's
      twenty-first birthday; her father was to arrive by the evening boat, and
      several of the young men had planned rowing and sailing races in her
      honor. Mr. and Mrs. Northrup, Miss Belmont, Hinton and I were chatting in
      a little summer house just by the edge of the lake, and a few feet away,
      Viola, Harry and Ethel were skipping flat stones over the water. In a
      pause in our talk, which had been of Byron, just after someone had quoted:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      She was his life,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The ocean to the river of his thoughts,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Which terminated all,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all looking at the trio outside and speculating probably upon the
      future of two of them, when we saw Ethel seize Miss Solander's hand, look
      up at her adoringly, and heard her say, in her childish pipes: &ldquo;You're so
      pretty! Why does mamma called you 'the colored lady?' You're not a nigger,
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl flushed painfully, but stooped, kissed the child and, looking
      straight at Mrs. Northrup, said very gently: &ldquo;No, dear; and if mamma knew
      me better she would not think I was colored.&rdquo; Then she turned, bowed
      slightly and walked rapidly up the beach. Nell burst into tears, Van Zandt
      muttered something that didn't sound like a prayer and tore after his lady
      love. Northrup was so startled and angry that, instead of comforting his
      wife, he gave her a little shake and exploded with: &ldquo;It's too &mdash;&mdash;-
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; bad! A nice mess you and the brat have
      made of things!&rdquo; Then, as the ludicrous side of the affair appealed to his
      fun-loving nature: &ldquo;To save time, I'll spank Ethel while you roll out the
      crust of a nice, re: &ldquo;To save time, I'll spank Ethel while you roll out
      the crust of a nice, big humble pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hinton and Miss Belmont slunk off, and I was preparing to follow them,
      when the unhappy little woman sobbed out, &ldquo;Oh, Doctor, please, please
      don't go! Stay and tell me what to do. Tom's so nasty&mdash;if you laugh,
      Tom dear, I'll kill you.&rdquo; So I stayed, and while we were consulting what
      was best to do Van Zandt came quietly into the summer house, his face and
      tightly-closed lips ashen, and his eyes the eyes of a strong man in pain.
      Nell rushed at him, exclaiming: &ldquo;My poor Harry, my darling brother! I am
      so sorry; try to forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put her away from him with no show of anger, but very coldly, and then,
      very evenly and in an emotionless, mechanical sort of way, he said: &ldquo;I
      have asked Miss Solander to be my wife. She refused me. I hope you are
      satisfied. I give you my word of honor that I will never forgive you, nor
      speak to you, until she accepts your apology and my love&mdash;and that
      will be never,&rdquo; he added, heavily, and half under his breath. There was no
      doubt that he meant it and would stick to it, and his sister, who knew he
      never broke his word, after one appealing look at him, threw herself in
      her husband's arms and sobbed miserably. I followed the boy and took an
      old man's privilege. He listened patiently and thanked me affectionately,
      but it was of no use. Then I tried to find Miss Viola, and came across
      Nell on the same quest; but no one saw her until the next afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday was cloudy and windy, a real gray day. The races were to begin at 3
      o'clock, and the entire community was gathered on the shore of the lake.
      Both Miss Solander and Van Zandt were entered, and I knew their pride
      would make them show up. The first race was for ladies in Long Lake boats
      over a half mile course and return, six entries, a handicap of one hundred
      yards on Miss Solander and fifty on Mrs. Claggett. Viola beat it
      handsomely and then rowed directly across to the island, where she would
      have a good view of the sailing race, though I think her object was more
      to escape the crowd.

    </h5>
    <p>
      After an interval of a few minutes three canoes, manned by Hinton, Van
      Zandt and another man, came up to the starter's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoes got away together, Van Zandt to leeward. They had gone perhaps
      a quarter of a mile when a squall from the opposite shore struck them, and
      the canoe with the violet pennant (Harry's) went over like a flash, the
      other two, with loose sheets, running before the wind. Mrs. Northrup
      screamed, and so did several other women; but Van Zandt was a capital
      swimmer, and I expected every moment to see him on the bottom of the
      canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a dozen men started in rowboats, but one shot out from the island and
      fairly flew for the capsized craft. It was Viola, and we saw her, when she
      reached her goal, stand up, shake off her outer skirts and dive. I had a
      powerful glass, and when she came up I saw she had him and was trying to
      reach her boat, which was drifting away. She gave that up and struggled
      toward the canoe. They went down, and then the rescue boats hid them. It
      seemed an eternity before two boats pulled swiftly toward us. In the first
      was Van Zandt, a nasty cut on his head and unconscious, but breathing
      faintly. In the next, held in the arms of poor &ldquo;Buttons,&rdquo; whose tears were
      dropping on her lovely white face, was the sweet child-woman, all the
      wonderful rose tints gone from lip and cheek and in its place the sad,
      cold hue of death. There was no sign of vitality, and I was hopeless from
      the first; but we were still working over her when the steamer came in,
      and the next thing we knew there was a heart-broken cry and her father had
      her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the bitter agony and yearning love in that strong man's cry that
      called back the fleeing life, or was it the sudden jar of lifting her and
      the fierce clasp of her father's arms that started the stilled lungs? I do
      not know; but, physician though I am, I incline to the former solution.
      Whatever may have been the cause there was a faint flutter in pulse and
      breast, and we renewed our efforts. In half an hour she was breathing
      softly and the color was coming back to her bonny face. Her father carried
      her up to the hotel and her aunt and Mrs. Northrup got her to bed. She
      recovered rapidly, but Van Zandt was pretty ill for about a week, and
      positively refused to see his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suppose it was officious and meddlesome in me, but one day when I
      knew where Violante was I took Nell's hand in my arm and brought them
      together. In a few minutes they were crying over each other in real
      womanly fashion, and I prowled off. In about ten minutes little Nell, her
      eyes shining with happiness, hunted me up and said, &ldquo;I want you to take me
      to Harry.&rdquo; She showed me in her hand a beautiful and curious ring, which I
      knew was the engagement ring of Miss Viola's mother. Harry was sitting in
      an easy chair, with his back to the door, when we entered, and, without
      turning his head, he asked, &ldquo;Is that you, Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered him, and then Nell stole up behind him, dropped the great ruby
      in his lap, and whispered, with a sob in her voice, &ldquo;With my dear sister
      Violante's love.&rdquo; Harry looked at the ring stupidly for an instant, then
      Nell came around in front of him, and he pulled her down into his arms
      without a word. And I stole away with wet eyes and a glad heart, and told
      the news to Tom and Carrie and that prince of good fellows, &ldquo;Jumbo&rdquo;
       Hinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is about all. Mr. Solander gave his consent and something more
      substantial, and two months later I went to the wedding of &ldquo;The Lady in
      Rouge.&rdquo;

      THE BREAKING OF WINTER, By Patience Stapleton
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat's the fust
      funerel I've went to sence I was a gal, but that I drove to the
      graveyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno as that done the corp enny good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' seems all to onc't I miss old Tige,&rdquo; muttered the first speaker half
      to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was snowing now, a fine mist sifting down on deep-drifted stone-walls
      and hard, shining roads, and the tinkle of sleigh-bells, as a far-away
      black line wound over the hill to the bleak graveyard, sounded musical and
      sweet in the muffled air. Two black figures in the dazzling white
      landscape left the traveled road and ploughed heavily along a lane leading
      to a grove of maples, cold and naked in the winter scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say Ann Kirk left a good prop'ty,&rdquo; said the first speaker, a woman
      of fifty, with sharp black eyes, red cheeks, few wrinkles and fewer gray
      hairs in the black waves under her pumpkin hood. She pulled her worn fur
      cape around her neck and took a new grasp on her shawl, pinning it tight.
      &ldquo;Ann an' me used to take a sight of comfort driving old Tige.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, her companion, grunted and went sturdily ahead. He was enveloped
      in a big overcoat, a scarf wound around his neck and a moth-eaten fur cap
      pulled down over his ears. His blue eyes were watery from the cold, his
      nose and chin peaked and purple, and frost clung to the short gray beard
      about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'll git the prop'ty?&rdquo; panted the woman. She held her gown up in front,
      disclosing a pair of blue socks drawn over her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relashuns, I s'pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was alius so savin', keepin' drip-pins for fryin', and sfellin'
      nearly every mite of butter they made; an' I've heered the Boston
      relashuns was extravagant. Her sister hed on a black silk to the funerel
      to ride to the grave in; I guess they are well-to-do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow then the woman remembered that glossy silk, and that she had never
      had one. Then this sister's husband, how attentive he was leading his wife
      out to the sleigh, and she had seen them walking arm-in-arm the past
      summer, when no man in Corinth ever offered his arm to his wife unless it
      were to a funeral and they were first mourners. &ldquo;Silas never give me his
      arm but the fust Sunday we were merried,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;bein' kind to
      wimmen wan't never the Loweirs way.&rdquo; A sharp pain in her side made her
      catch her breath and stop a moment, but the man paid no heed to her
      distress. At the end of a meadow on a little rise looking down a long,
      shady lane, stood a gray old farm-house, to which age had given
      picturesqueness and beauty, and here Maria Lowell had lived the thirty
      years of her married life. She unlocked the door and went into the cold
      kitchen where the fire had died down. A lean cat came purring from under
      the table, and the old clock seemed to tick more cheerily now the mistress
      had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A buryin' on Christmas Eve, the minister said, and how sad it were, and I
      felt like tellin' him Ann an' me never knowed Christmas from enny other
      day, even to vittles, for turkeys fetched better prices then, an' we sold
      ourn.&rdquo; She went into a frozen bedroom, for Corinth folks would have
      thought a man crazy to have a fire in a sleeping-room except in sickness;
      she folded her shawl and cape and laid them carefully on the feather bed,
      covered with its gay quilt, the fruit of her lonely hours. Mechanically
      she set about getting supper, stirring the fire, putting a pan of soda
      biscuits in to bake, and setting a dish of dried-apple sauce and a plate
      of ginger cookies on the table. &ldquo;Berried on Chrismus Eve, but little she
      ever thought of it, nor me, and little of it Jimmy hed here to home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her biscuits, slammed the oven door, glanced cautiously
      around to see if Silas, who had gone to milk the cow, were coming; then
      drawing her thin lips tighter, went back into the cold bedroom. With
      ruthless hand tearing open an old wound, she unlocked a drawer in the old
      mahogany bureau and took out something rolled in a handkerchief&mdash;only
      a tiny vase, blue and gilt, woefully cheap, laughed at by the cultured,
      scorned by the children of today. She held it tenderly in her cold hand
      and brought back the memory that would never die. It was years and years
      ago in that very room, and a little child came in holding one chubby hand
      behind him, and he looked at her with her own bright eyes under his curly
      hair. &ldquo;Muver, Jimmy's got a s'prise.&rdquo; She remembered she told him crossly
      to go out of the cold room and not bother her. She remembered, too, that
      his lip quivered, the lip that had yet the baby curve. &ldquo;It was a present,
      muver, like the minister sed. I got candy on the tree, but you didn't git
      nawthin', and I buyed you this with my berry money.&rdquo; The poor little vase
      in that warm chubby hand&mdash;ay, she forgot nothing now; she told him he
      was silly to spend good money on trash, and flung the vase aside, but that
      grieved childish face came back always. Ah, it would never fade away, it
      had returned for a quarter of a century. &ldquo;I never was used to young ones,&rdquo;
       she said aloud, &ldquo;nor kindness,&rdquo; but that would not heal the wound; no
      self-apology could. She went hurriedly to the kitchen, for Silas was
      stamping the snow off his feet in the entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got fifty dollars for old Tige,&rdquo; he said, as he poured his tea into his
      saucer to cool; &ldquo;he was wuth it, the honest old creetur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little black-eyed woman did not answer; she only tightened her lips.
      Over the mantel where the open fireplace had been bricked up, was a
      picture in a narrow black frame, a colored print of Washington on a fine
      white horse, and maidens strewing flowers in his pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Tige was feelin' good,&rdquo; continued Silas, &ldquo;he'd a monstrous likeness
      to thet hoss in the pictur, monstrous! held his hed high an' pranced; done
      you good to see him in Bath when them hosses tried to parss him; you'd a
      thort he was a four-year-old! chock full of pride. The hackman sed he was
      a good 'un, but run down; I don't 'low to overfeed stock when they ain't
      wurkin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ourn has the name of bein' half starved,&rdquo; muttered the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silas looked at her in some surprise. &ldquo;I ginerelly gits good prices for
      'em all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ginerelly overreach every one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' to Ann's funerel hez sorter upset ye, M'ri. Lord, how old Tige
      would cavort when Jim would ride him; throw out his heels like a colt. I
      never told the hackman Tige was eighteen year old. I ain't over pertikler
      in a hoss trade, like everybody else. He wun't last long I calc'late now,
      for them hack horses is used hard, standin' out late nights in the cold
      an'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the Wilkins place sold out ter-day?&rdquo; said the woman hastily, with
      agonizing impatience to divert his thoughts to something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it were,&rdquo; chuckled Silas, handing his cup for more tea, &ldquo;an' they'll
      have ter move ter Bosting. You was ginning me for bein' mean, how'd you
      like to be turned outer doors? Ef I do say it, there ain't no money due on
      my prop'ty, nor never was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who air you savin' it fur?&rdquo; said Maria, quietly. She sat with downcast
      eyes tapping her spoon idly on her saucer; she had eaten nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fur myself,&rdquo; he growled, pushing his chair back. He lit a pipe and began
      to smoke, his feet at the oven door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside it was quite dark, snow and night falling together in a dense
      black pall. Over the lonely roads drifted the snow, and no footfall marred
      it. Through drear, silent forests it sifted, sifted down, clung to cheery
      evergreens, and clasped shining summer trees that had no thought for
      winter woes; it was heaped high over the glazed brooks that sang, deep
      down, songs of summer time and gladness, like happy, good old folks whose
      hearts are ever young and joyous. Over the wide Kennebec, in the line of
      blue the ferry-boat kept open, the flakes dropped, dropped and made no
      blurr, like the cellar builders of temples and palaces, the rank and file,
      the millions of good, unknown dead, unmentioned in history or the Bible.
      The waves seething in the confined path crackled the false ice around the
      edges, leaped upon it in miniature breakers, and swirled far underneath
      with hoarse murmur. In the dark water something dark rose and fell with
      the tide. Was there a human being drifting to death in the icy sea? The
      speck made no outcry; it battled nobly with nature's mighty force. Surely
      and slowly the high wharfs and the lights of Bath faded; nearer grew the
      woods of Corinth, the ferry landing and the tavern-keeper's lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heered suthin' on the ferry slip,&rdquo; said a little old man in the tavern,
      holding his hand behind his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nawthin', night's too black,&rdquo; said the tavern-keeper; &ldquo;you're alius a
      hearin' what no one else do, Beaman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No star nor human eye had seen the black speck on the wild water, and no
      hand lent it aid to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ugly silence Silas smoked his pipe, while equally still, Maria washed
      the dishes. She stepped to throw the dish-water outside the door and then
      she heard a sound. The night was so quiet a noise traveled miles. What was
      it, that steady smothered thud up the lane where so seldom a stranger
      came? Was it only the beating of her heart after all? She shut the door
      behind her and hurried out, wrapping her wet cold hands in her apron.
      Suddenly there came a long, joyful neigh!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on airth did that critter git home?&rdquo; cried Silas, jumping to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer, nearer, in a grand gallop, with tense muscles and quivering limbs,
      with upraised head and flying mane, with eager eyes, nearer, in great
      leaps thrusting time and distance far behind, came that apparition of the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried the woman wildly, &ldquo;old Tige has come home&mdash;come
      home to this place, and there is one living thing that loves it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light flared out from the open door. &ldquo;How on airth did he git across
      the river?&rdquo; said Silas, querulously. &ldquo;An' how am I goin' to git him back
      in this weather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he stood, the noble old horse that her boy had raised from a colt,
      had ridden, had given to her when he went away. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; her boy had
      said, &ldquo;be good to old Tige. If ever father wants to sell him, don't you
      let him. I'd come back from my grave if the old horse was abused&mdash;the
      only thing I loved, that loved me in this place I cannot call a home.
      Remember he has been so faithful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ay, he had been faithful, in long, hot summer days, in wide, weary fields,
      in breaking the stony soil for others' harvest, in bringing wood from the
      far forest, in every way of burden and work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood quivering with cold, covered with ice, panting after his wild
      gallop; but he was home, poor brute mind! That old farm was his home: he
      had frolicked in its green fields as a colt, had carried a merryvoiced
      young master, had worked and rested in that old place; he might be
      ill-treated and starved, he did not grieve, he did not question, for it
      was home! He could not understand why this time the old master had not
      taken him away; never before had he been left in Bath. In his brute way he
      reasoned he had been forgotten, and when his chance came, leaped from the
      barn, running as horse never ran before, plunged off the wharf into the
      black waves, swam across and galloped to his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is a God in Heaven, that horse shall not go back!&rdquo; cried the
      woman fiercely; &ldquo;if you take him from here again it shall be over my dead
      body! Ay, you may well look feared; for thirty years I have frozen my
      heart, even to my own son, and now the end's come. It needed that faithful
      brute to teach me; it needed that one poor creature that loved me and this
      place, to open the flood-gates. Let me pass, and I warn you to keep away
      from me. Women go mad in this lonely, starved life. Ay, you are a man, but
      I am stronger now than you ever were. I've been taught all my life to mind
      men, to be driven by them, and to-night is a rising of the weak. Put me in
      the asylum, as other wives are, but tonight my boy's horse shall be
      treated as never before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But M'ri,&rdquo; he said, trembling, &ldquo;there, there now, let me git the lantern,
      you're white as a sheet! We'll keep him if you say so; why hadn't you told
      me afore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung him aside, lit the lantern and then ran up to an attic chamber
      under the eaves. &ldquo;M'ri, you hain't goin' to kill yourself?&rdquo; he quavered,
      waiting at the foot of the stairs. She was back in a moment, her arms full
      of blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on airth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone, Silas Lowell, these were my weddin' blankets. I've saved
      'em thirty years in the cedar chist for this. They was too good for you
      and me; they air too poor fur my boy's horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's a good hoss blanket in the barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law don't give you these; it mebbe gives you me, but these is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung by him, and he heard the barn door rattle back. He put on his
      coat and went miserably after her, &ldquo;M'ri, here's yer shawl, you'll git yer
      death.&rdquo; The barn lit by the lantern revealed two astonished oxen, a
      mild-eyed cow, a line of hens roosting on an old hayrack and Maria rubbing
      the frozen sides of the white horse. &ldquo;Put yer shawl on, M'ri, you'll git
      yer death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you'd lose my work, eh? Leave me, I say, I'm burning up; I never will
      be cold till I'm dead. I can die! there is death 'lowed us poor critters,
      an' coffins to pay fur, and grave lots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silas picked up a piece of flannel and began to rub the horse. In ghastly
      quiet the two worked, the man patching the woman, and looking timorously
      at the axe in the corner. One woman in the neighborhood, living on a
      cross-road where no one ever came, had gone mad and jnur-dered her
      husband, but &ldquo;M'ri&rdquo; had always been so clear-headed! Then the woman went
      and began piling hay in the empty stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't goin' to use thet good hay fur beddin,' be ye, M'ri?&rdquo; asked
      Silas in pathetic anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you let me be. Who has a better right to this? His labor cut it
      and hauled it; this is a time when the laborer shall git his hire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silas went on rubbing, listening in painful silence to the click of the
      lock on the grain bin, and the swish of oats being poured into a trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't give him too much, M'ri,&rdquo; he pleaded humbly, &ldquo;I don't mean ter be
      savin', but he'll eat hisself to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first that ever did on this place,&rdquo; laughed the woman wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then standing on the milking-stool she piled the blankets on the grateful
      horse, then led him to the stall where she stood and watched him eat. &ldquo;I
      never see you so free 'round a hoss afore,&rdquo; said Silas; &ldquo;you used to be
      skeered of 'em, he might kick ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't because he ain't a man,&rdquo; she answered shrilly; &ldquo;it's only men
      that gives blows for kindness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land of the living!&rdquo; cried Silas, as a step sounded on the floor, and a
      queer figure came slowly into the glare of light by the lantern, a figure
      that had a Rembrandt effect in the shadow&mdash;an old man, lean and tall,
      shrouded in a long coat and bearing on his back a heavy basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't be a human creetur, comin' here to-night,&rdquo; said Maria; &ldquo;mebbe
      you're the Santy Claus Jim used to tell on as the boys told him; no man in
      his senses would come to Sile Lowell's fur shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'ri's upsot,&rdquo; said Silas meekly, taking the lantern with trembling hand;
      &ldquo;I guess you've got off the road; the tavern's two mile down toward the
      river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've followed the right road,&rdquo; said Maria; &ldquo;you've come at a day of
      reck'nin'; everythin' in the house, the best, you shall have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She snatched the light from Silas and slammed the barn door, leaving Tige
      contentedly champing his oats, wondering if he was still dreaming, and if
      his wild swim had been a nightmare followed by a vision of plenty. In the
      kitchen Maria filled the stove, lit two lamps and began making new tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet was a good strong drorin' we hed fur supper, M'ri,&rdquo; said Silas,
      plaintively, keenly conscious of previous economies; &ldquo;'pears to me you
      don't need no new.&rdquo; She paid no heed to him, but set the table with the
      best dishes, the preserves&mdash;Silas noted with a groan&mdash;and then
      with quick, skillful hand began cutting generous slices of ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're hungry, sir?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I be, marm,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;an' if it ain't no trouble, I'll
      set this ere basket nigh the stove, there's things in it as will spile. I
      be consederable hungry, ain't eat a bite sence yesterd'y.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silas's face grew longer and longer; he looked at the hamper hopefully.
      That might contain a peddler's outfit and &ldquo;M'ri&rdquo; could get paid that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I hain't money nor nawthin' to pay fur my vittles 'less there was
      wood-sawin' to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wood's all sawed,&rdquo; said Silas bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't take a cent,&rdquo; went on Maria, with flushed cheeks and sparkling
      eyes. &ldquo;Ann Kirk thet hed the name of bein' as mean as me, was berried to
      day, and folks that keered nawthin' fur her is a goin' to hev her money
      an' make it fly. They say 'round here no grass will ever grow on her
      grave, fur ev'ry blade will be blarsted by the curses of the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'ri, you a perfessed Christian!&rdquo; cried Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's good folks unperfessed,&rdquo; interposed the stranger; &ldquo;but I dunno
      but a near Christian is better nor a spendthrift one as fetches up at the
      poorhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you air!&rdquo; said Silas, almost affably feeling he had an advocate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was tall and bony, with a thin, wrinkled face bronzed by wind
      and weather, with a goatee and mustache of pale brown hair, and a sparse
      growth of the same above a high bald forehead; his eyes were a faded
      brown, too, and curiously wistful in expression. His clothing was worn and
      poor, his hands work-hardened, and he stooped slightly. When the meal was
      ready he drew up to the table, Maria plying him with food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather have coffee?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you've got me, marm, but land! tea'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would,&rdquo; snarled Silas; but his grumbling was silenced
      in the grinding of the coffee mill. When the ap-appetizing odor floated
      from the stove, Silas sniffed it, and his stomach began to yearn. &ldquo;You put
      in a solid cup full,&rdquo; he muttered, trying to worry himself into refusing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want a lot,&rdquo; laughed Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set up an' eat,&rdquo; called the stranger cheerily; &ldquo;let's make a banquet;
      it's Chrismus Eve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ham do smell powerful good,&rdquo; muttered Silas, unconsciously drawing
      his chair up to the table, where the stranger handed him a plate and
      passed the ham. Maria went on frying eggs, as if, thought her husband,
      &ldquo;they warn't twenty-five cents a dozen,&rdquo; and then ran down into the
      cellar, returning panting and good-humored with a pan of apples and a jug
      of cider; then into the pantry, bringing a tin box out of which she took a
      cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's pound cake, M'ri,&rdquo; cried Silas, aghast, holding his knife and fork
      upraised in mute horror. She went on cutting thick slices, humming under
      her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I, marm,&rdquo; asked the stranger, pleasantly, &ldquo;put this slice of ham
      and cake and this cup of milk aside, to eat bymeby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many meals do you eat in a evening?&rdquo; growled Silas, awestruck at such
      an appetite; &ldquo;an' I want you to know this ain't no tavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do eat a bite yourself, marm,&rdquo; said the stranger, as Maria carried the
      filled plate to the cupboard. The impudence of a tramp actually asking the
      mistress of the house to eat her own food, thought Silas. &ldquo;We've eat our
      supper,&rdquo; he hurled at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't tech a mite,&rdquo; said Maria, beginning to clear up, and as he was
      through eating, the stranger gallantly helped her while Silas smoked in
      speechless rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm used to being handy,&rdquo; explained the tramp. &ldquo;I allus helped wife.
      She's bin dead these twenty years, leaving me a baby girl that I brought
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You was good to her?&rdquo; asked Maria wistfully; the stranger had such a kind
      voice and gentle ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I done the best I could, marm.&rdquo; Doubting his senses, Silas saw Maria
      bring out the haircloth rocking-chair with the bead tidy from the best
      front room. &ldquo;Lemme carry it,&rdquo; said the tramp politely. &ldquo;Now set in't
      yerself, marin, an' be comfurble.&rdquo; He took a wooden chair, tilted it back
      and picked up the cat. Maria, before she sat down, unmindful of Silas's
      bewildered stare, filled one of his pipes with his tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you smoke, mister,&rdquo; she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I do,&rdquo; answered the tramp, whiffing away in great comfort. &ldquo;'Pears
      to me you're the biggest-hearted woman I ever see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed bitterly. &ldquo;There wan't a cluser woman in Corinth than me, an'
      folks'll tell you so. I turned my own son outer doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was part my fault, Mri, an' you hush now,&rdquo; pleaded Silas, forgiving
      even her giving his tobacco away if she would not bring out that family
      skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heered you was cluse,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;an' thet you sent Jim off
      because he went to circuses in Bath, an' wore store clothes, an' wanted
      wages to pay for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All true,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;an' he wanted to ride the horse, an' was mad at
      workin' him so hard.&rdquo; She went on then, and told how the old animal had
      come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' me thinkin' the critter was a speerit,&rdquo; said the stranger in a hushed
      voice. &ldquo;Beat's all what a dumb brute knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought mebbe,&rdquo; went on Maria, twisting her thin fingers, &ldquo;as Jim might
      be comin' home this time. They says things happens curious when folks is
      goin' ter die&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your good fur a good meny years, M'ri,&rdquo; said Silas, pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's folks in this wurld,&rdquo; said the stranger, his kindly face growing
      sad and careworn since the mother's eager words, &ldquo;that ain't men enuff,
      an' comes to charity to the end&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there be,&rdquo; assented Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as can't bring up their folks comfurble, nor keep 'em well an' happy,
      nor have a home as ain't berried under a mortgage they can't never clear
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there's lots of 'em,&rdquo; cried Silas, &ldquo;an' Mis Lowell was a twitting me
      this very night of bein' mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' this good home, an' the fields I passed thro', an' the lane where the
      old hoss come a gallopin' up behind me, is paid fur, no mortgage on a
      acre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never was on the Lowell prop'ty; they'll tell ye thet ennywhere,&rdquo;
       said Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We uns in the South, where I come from,&rdquo; said the stranger, shading his
      face with his bony hand, &ldquo;ain't never forehanded somehow. My name is
      Dexter Brown, marm, an' I was alius misfortinat. I tell you, marm, one day
      when my creditors come an' took the cotton off my field, thet I'd plarnted
      and weeded and worked over in the brilin' sun, my wife says&mdash;an'
      she'd been patient and long-sufferin'&mdash;'Dex, I'm tired out; jest you
      bury me in a bit of ground that's paid fur, an' I'll lie in peace,' an'
      she died thet night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe she never knowed what it were to scrimp an' save, an' do without,
      an never see nawthin', till all the good died in her,&rdquo; muttered Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part o' my debt was wines an' good vittles fur her, marm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant!&rdquo; said Maria quickly, &ldquo;an' she never wept over the graves of
      her dead children, an' heered their father complainin' of how much their
      sickness hed cost him. Oh, I tell you, there's them that reckons human
      agony by dollars an' cents, an' they're wus'n murderers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'ri!&rdquo; cried Silas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe, marm, you are over-worrited ternight,&rdquo; said the stranger softly;
      &ldquo;wimmen is all feelin', God bless 'em! an' how yer son loved ye, a tellin'
      of yer bright eyes an' red cheeks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him with fierce eagerness. &ldquo;He couldn't keer fur me, I wan't
      the kind. I don't mind me of hardly ever kissin' him. I worked him hard; I
      was cross an' stingy. He sed to me, 'There's houses that is never homes,
      mother.' I sneered an' blamed him for his little present.&rdquo; She ran and
      brought the vase. &ldquo;I've kept that, Mr. Brown, over twenty years, but when
      he give it to me, bought outer his poor little savin's, I scolded him. I
      never let him hev the boys here to pop corn or make candy; it was waste
      and litter. Oh, I know what he meant; this was never a home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he only spoke kind of ye alius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know Jim? Been gone this ten year, an' never a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silas, a queer shadow on his face, looked eagerly at Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did know him,&rdquo; slowly and cautiously&mdash;&ldquo;he was a cowboy in Texas,
      as brave as the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could ride,&rdquo; cried Maria, &ldquo;as part of a horse, an' Tige was the dead
      image of that Washington horse in the pictur, an' Jim used to say thet
      girl there in the blue gown was his girl&mdash;the one with the bouquet;
      an' I used to call him silly. I chilled all the fun he hed outer him, an'
      broken-speerited an' white-faced he drifted away from us, as far away as
      them in the graveyard, with the same weary look as they hed in goin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he took keer of much as a hundred cattle,&rdquo; said Silas; &ldquo;they has thet
      meny I've heerd, in Texas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They has thousands; they loses hundreds by drought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanter know?&rdquo; cried Silas, his imagination refusing to grasp such awful
      loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I knowed Jim, an' he got mer-ried&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merried!&rdquo; from both the old parents. &ldquo;He did. He says, 'I wunt write the
      home-folks till I'm well off, for mother will worrit an' blame me, an' I
      hain't money, but Minnie an' I love each other, an' are satisfied with
      little.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minnie,&rdquo; the mother repeated. &ldquo;Was she pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman all over you be, to ask thet, an' she was,&rdquo; said Brown, sadly;
      &ldquo;with dark eyes, sorter wistful, an' hair like crinkled sunshine, an' a
      laugh like a merry child, fur trouble slipped off her shoulders like water
      off a duck's back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' they got prosperous?&rdquo; asked Silas uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They was happy,&rdquo; said Brown with gentle dignity; &ldquo;they was alius happy,
      but they lived under a mortgage, an' it was drift from pillar to post, an'
      ups an' downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' they're poor now,&rdquo; muttered Silas, visions of Jim and his family to
      support coming to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Maria. &ldquo;Tell me, sir, was there children? Oh, the heart
      hunger I've had for the sound of a child's voice, the touch of baby hands.
      You an' me grandpa and grandma, Sile! an', my God! you think of money
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set calm,&rdquo; pleaded Brown, &ldquo;for I must hev courage to tell ye all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' they sent ye to tell us they was comin'?&rdquo; asked Silas, judging of
      their prosperity from the shabby herald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They asked me to come, an' I swore it. There's a queer blight as creeps
      inter our country, which without thet might be like everlasting Paradise.
      Ourn is a land of summer an' flowers, but up here in this ice-bound
      region, the air is like water in runnin' brooks, it puts life an' health
      in ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the blight o' consumption here. We're foreordained to suffer all
      over this airth,&rdquo; muttered the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there it comes in waves of trouble&mdash;in awful haste&mdash;an'
      takes all at once, an' them that's well flees away and the sick dies
      alone. So the yellow fever come creepin' inter my home, fur Minnie was my
      child&mdash;the daughter I'd keered fur; an' fust the baby went from her
      arms, an' then little Silas (arter you, sir). Then Minnie sickened, an'
      her laugh is only an echo in my heart, for she died and was berried, the
      baby in her arms, and Jim was took next&mdash;an' he says&rdquo; (only the
      ticking of the clock sounded now, never so loud before): &ldquo;'I want you,
      dad,' (he called me dad) 'to go to my old home in Maine. I want you to
      tell my father I named my dead boy for him, and I thought of his frugal,
      saving life with pain, and yet I am proud that his name is respected as
      that of an honest man, whose word is his bond. I'll never go up the old
      lane again,' says Jim, 'nor see mother standing in the door with her
      bright eyes and red cheeks that I used to think was like winter apples.
      And the old horse, she said she'd care for, I won't see him again, nor
      hear the bells. In this land of summer I only long for winter, and dad, if
      I could hear those hoarse old jolly bells I'd die in peace. Queer, ain't
      it? And I remember some rides I took mother; she wan't afraid of the colt,
      and looked so pretty, a white hood over her dark hair. You go, dad, and
      say I was sorry, and I'd planned to come some day prosperous and happy,
      but it's never to be. Tell mother to think of me when she goes a Sunday
      afternoon to the buryin'-ground, as she used to with me, and by those
      little graves I fek her mother's heart beat for me, her living child, and
      I knew, though she said nothing, she cared for me.' He died tell-in' me
      this, marm, an' was berried by my girl, an' I think it was meant kind they
      went together, for both would a pined apart. So I've come all the way from
      Texas, trampin' for weary months, for I was poor, to give you Jim's
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! Jim dead!&rdquo; cried Silas, in a queer, dazed way. &ldquo;M'ri,&rdquo; querulously,
      &ldquo;you alius sed he was so helthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to him and laid her hand on his bowed head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' we've saved an' scrimped an' pinched fur strangers, M'ri, fur there
      ain't no Lowell to have the prop'ty, an' I meant it all fur Jim. When he
      was to come back he'd find he was prosperous, an' he'd think how I tried
      to make him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord don't mean all dark clouds in this life,&rdquo; said the stranger.
      &ldquo;Out of that pestilence, that never touched her with its foul breath, came
      a child, with Minnie's face and laugh, but Jim's own eyes&mdash;a bit of
      mother an' father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old people were looking at him with painful eagerness, dwelling on his
      every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was little May; named Maria, but we called her May for she was borned
      three year ago in that month; a tiny wee thing, an' I stood by their
      graves an' I hardened my heart. 'They drove her father out; they sha'n't
      crush her young life,' I said. 'I'll keep her.' But I knowed I couldn't.
      Poverty was grinding me, and with Jim's words directin' me, I brought her
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought her here!&rdquo; cried the poor woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! She's a brave little lass, an' I told her to lie quiet in the basket
      till I told her to come out, fur mebbe you wan't kind an' would send us
      both out, but I found your hearts ready fur her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one spring Maria reached the basket and flung open the lid,
      disclosing a tiny child wrapped in a ragged shawl, sleeping peacefully in
      her cramped bed, but with tears on her long lashes, as if the waiting had
      tried her brave little soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest as gritty,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;an' so good to mind; poor lass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria lifted her out, and the child woke up, but did not cry at the
      strange face that smiled on her with such pathetic eagerness. &ldquo;Oh, the
      kitty!&rdquo; cried May. &ldquo;I had a kitty once!&rdquo; That familiar household object
      reconciled her at once. She ate the cake eagerly and drank the milk,
      insisting on feeding the ham to the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him looks hungry,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've all been starved!&rdquo; cried Maria, clasping the child to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a beautiful child, with her merry eyes and laugh and her golden
      curls, a strange blossom from a New England soil, yet part of her
      birthright was the land of flowers and sunshine. Somehow that pathetic
      picture of the past faded when the mother saw a blue and gilt vase in the
      baby's hand&mdash;Jim's baby's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's pitty; fank you!&rdquo; said the little creature. Then she got down to
      show her new dress and her shoes, and made excursions into the pantry,
      opening cupboard doors, but touching nothing, only exclaiming, &ldquo;Dear me,
      how pitty!&rdquo; at everything. Then she came back, and at Brown's request,
      with intense gravity, began a Spanish dance she had learned when they
      stopped at San Antonio, from watching the Mexican senoritas. She held up
      her little gown on one side and gravely made her steps while Dexter
      whistled. The fire leaped up and crackled loudly, as if it would join her,
      the cat purred, the tea-kettle sung from the back of the stove, and little
      snowflakes, themselves hurrying, skurrying in a merry dance, clung to the
      win dow-pane and called other little flakes to hasten and see such a
      pretty sight. Maria watched in breathless eagerness, and Silas, carried
      beyond himself, forgetting his scruples, cried out: &ldquo;Wal, ef that don't
      beat all I ever see! Come here, you little chick!&rdquo; holding out his silver
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a final pirouette she finished with a grave little courtesy, then ran
      to Silas: &ldquo;Is there birdie in der?&rdquo; and he caught her up and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the old lane is shady in summertime, and golden-rod and daisies crowd
      the way, and raspberries climb the stonewall, and merry squirrels chatter
      and mock the red-breasted robins, and bees go humming through the ordorous
      air, there comes a big white horse that looks like Washington's in the
      picture; and how carefully he walks and bears himself, for he brings a
      little princess who has made the old house a home. Such a fairylike little
      thing, who from her sunshine makes everybody bright and happy, and Silas'
      grim old face is smiling as he leads the horse, and Maria, with her basket
      of berries, is helped over the wall by Dexter Brown, who always says he
      must go but never does, for they love him, and he and Silas work
      harmoniously together. And grandma's eyes are brighter than ever and her
      cheeks as red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What comfortable folks they air gittin' to be,&rdquo; say the neighbors,
      &ldquo;kinder livin', but I dunno but goin' a berryin' a hull arternoon is right
      down shiftless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winter is over and forever gone from that household on the hill; the
      coming of gracious, smiling spring in a sweet child's presence has made
      eternal sunshine in those ice-bound hearts.

      CYNTHY'S JOE, By Clara Sprague Ross
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DON'T think he'll
      be sech a fool as to p'int fer home the fust thing he does.&rdquo; The speaker,
      a young man with a dull, coarse face and slouching air, knocked the ashes
      from a half-smoked cigar with his little finger, which was heavily
      ornamented with a large seal ring, and adjusted himself to a more
      comfortable position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dun'no which p'int o' the compass he'd more naterally turn to,&rdquo;
       observed another; an elderly man with a stoop in his shoulders, and a
      sharp, thin face that with all its petty shrewdness was not without its
      compensating feature&mdash;a large and kindly mouth. The third man in the
      little group was slowly walking back and forth on the platform that ran
      across the station, rolling and unrolling a small red flag which he held
      in his hands. He turned with a contemptuous &ldquo;umph&rdquo; to the young man,
      remarking as he did so, &ldquo;'Tain't mostly fools as goes to prison. Joe
      Atherton prob'ly has as many friends in this section o' the kentry as some
      who hain't been away so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe was a good little boy,&rdquo; pursued the old station-master; &ldquo;he wuz
      allers kind to his mother. I never heard a word ag'in him till that city
      swell came down here fer the summer and raised blazes with the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there ain't the Squire!&rdquo; exclaimed a hitherto silent member; &ldquo;he's the
      last man as I should jedge would come to the deepo to welcome Joe
      Atherton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stout, florid, pompous individual slowdy mounted the platform steps,
      wiping his forehead with a flaming red silk handkerchief, which he had
      taken from his well-worn straw hat. &ldquo;Warm afternoon, friends,&rdquo; he
      suggested, with an air of having vastly contributed to the information of
      the men, whose only apparent concern in life was an anxiety to find a
      shady corner within conversational distance of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire seated himself in the only chair of which the forlorn station
      boasted; he leaned back until his head was conveniently supported, and
      furtively glanced at a large old-fashioned watch which he drew from his
      vest pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Train's late this a'ternoon, Squar',&rdquo; said the man with the red flag. &ldquo;I
      reckon ye'll all hev to go home without seein' the show; 'tain't no ways
      sartin Joe'll come to-day. Parson Mayhew sed his time was up the fust week
      in September, but there's no tellin' the day as I knows on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sustained, heavy rumble sounded in the distance. Each man straightened
      himself and turned his head to catch the first glimpse of the approaching
      engine, With a shriek and only a just perceptible lessening of its speed,
      the mighty train rushed by them without stopping, and was out of sight
      before the eager watchers regained the power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the red flag was in its place behind the door, its
      keeper turned the key and hastened to overtake his neighbor, who had
      reached the highway. Hearing the hurrying footsteps behind him, the man
      turned, saying triumphantly, &ldquo;I'm right-down, glad he didn't come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be I; there's an express late this evenin' that might bring him down.
      I shall be here if Louisy's so as I kin leave her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;I shan't be over ag'in to-night, but you
      jest tell Joe, fer me, to come right ta my house; he's welcome. Whatever
      he done as a boy, he's atoned fer in twenty years. I remember jest how
      white and sot his face was the day they took him away; he was only a boy
      then, he's a man now, gray-headed most likely; the Athertons turned gray
      early, and sorrow and sin are terrible helps to white hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man's voice faltered a little; he drew the back of his hard, brown
      hand across his eyes. Something that neither of the men could have defined
      prompted them to shake hands at the &ldquo;Corners&rdquo;; they did so silently, and
      without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe came that night. The moon and the stars were the silent and only
      witnesses of the convict's return. It was just as Joe had hoped it might
      be; yet there was in the man's soul an awful sense of his loneliness and
      isolation The eager, wistful light faded out of his large blue eyes, the
      lines about his firm, tightly-drawn mouth deepened, the whole man took on
      an air of sullen defiance. Nobody cared for him, why should he care? He
      wondered if &ldquo;Uncle Aaron,&rdquo; as the boys used to call him, still kept the
      old station and signaled the trains. Alas! it was one of &ldquo;Louisy's&rdquo; bad
      nights; her husband could not leave her, and so Joe missed forever the
      cordial hand old Aaron would have offered him, and the kind message he was
      to give him, for his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly, wearily, Joe turned and walked toward the road, lying white and
      still in the moonlight. His head dropped lower and lower upon his breast;
      without lifting it he put out his hand, at length, and raised the latch of
      a dilapidated gate that opened into a deep, weed-entangled yard. His heart
      was throbbing wildly, a fierce, hot pain shot through his eyes. Could he
      ever look up? He knew the light of the home he was seeking had gone out in
      darkness years before. The only love in the world that would have met him
      without question or reproach was silent forever; but here was her home&mdash;his
      home once&mdash;the little white house with its green blinds and shady
      porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must look up or his heart would burst. With a cry that rang loud and
      clear on the quiet night, he fell upon his face, his fingers clutching and
      tearing the long, coarse grass. There was no house&mdash;no home&mdash;only
      a mass of blackened timbers, a pile of ashes, the angle of a tumbling
      wall. Hardly knowing what he did, Joe crept into the shelter of the old
      stone wall. With his face buried in his hands he lived over again, in one
      short half-hour, the life he hoped he had put away when the prison doors
      closed behind him. All through the day there had struggled in his heart a
      faint, unreasoning faith that life might yet hold something fair for him;
      one ray of comfort, one word of kindness, and faith would have become a
      reality. As the man, at last lifted his pale, agonized face to the
      glittering sky above him he uttered no word of prayer or entreaty, but
      with the studied self-control that years of repression had taught him, he
      rose from the ground and walked slowly out of the yard and down the
      cheerless road again to the station. Life hereafter could mean nothing to
      him but a silent moving-on. Whenever or wherever he became known, men
      would shrink and turn away from him. There was no abiding-place, no home,
      no love for him in all God's mighty world. He accepted the facts; there
      was only one relief&mdash;somewhere, some time, a narrow bed would open
      for him and the green sod would shelter the man and his sin till eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily plucked a bit of golden-rod that nodded by the roadside; then
      taking a small, ragged book from a pocket just over his heart, he opened
      it and put the yellow spray between the leaves. As he did so a bit of
      paper fluttered to the ground. Joe stooped and picked it up. It was a
      letter he had promised to deliver from a fellow-prisoner to his mother in
      a distant town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very far away an engine whistled at a crossing. A slowly moving
      freight and accommodation train pulled up at the depot a few moments
      later. Joe entered the dark, ill-smelling car at the rear and turned his
      face once more to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the early twilight of the next evening that Joe found himself in
      the hurry and confusion of a large manufacturing town. As he passed from
      the great depot into the brilliantly lighted street, he was bewildered for
      a moment and stood irresolute, with his hand shading his eyes. At one
      corner of the park that lay between the station and the next street, a man
      with a Punch-and-Judy theatre had drawn around him a crowd of men, women,
      and children. Joe mechanically directed his steps that way, and
      unconsciously became a part of the swaying, laughing audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold me up once more, do Mariar, I can't see nothin',&rdquo; begged a piping,
      childish voice at Joe's knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, Cynthy; my arms is most broke now holdin' of ye; ef you don't
      stop teasin' I'll never take ye nowheres again,&rdquo; replied a tall, handsome
      girl, to whom the child was clinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe bent without a word, and picking up the small, ill-shaped morsel of
      human longing and curiosity, swung her upon his broad shoulder, where she
      sat watching the tiny puppets and listening to their shrill cries,
      oblivious of all else in the world. Once she looked down into the man's
      face with her great, dark, fiery eyes and said softly, &ldquo;Oh, how good you
      are!&rdquo; A shiver ran through Joe's frame; these were the first words that
      had been addressed to him since he said good-bye to the warden in that
      dreary corridor, which for this one moment had been forgotten. The little
      girl, without turning her eyes from the dancing figures before her, put
      one arm about Joe's neck and nestled a little closer to him. Joe could
      have stood forever. The tall, dark girl, however, had missed Cynthy's
      tiresome pulling at her skirts and the whining voice. She looked anxiously
      about and called &ldquo;Cynthy! Cynthy! where are you? I'll be thankful if ever
      I gets you back to your grandmother.&rdquo; The fretful words aroused Joe from
      his happy reverie; he hurriedly placed the child on the pavement, and in
      an instant was lost in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set out upon his quest the following morning and had no difficulty in
      finding the old woman he was seeking. At one of a dozen doors marking as
      many divisions of a long, low tenement building near the river, he had
      knocked, and the door had opened into a small, clean kitchen, where a
      bright fire burned in a tiny stove, and a row of scarlet geraniums in pots
      ornamented the front window. The woman who admitted him he recognized at
      once as the mother of the man in that far-away prison, whose last
      hold-upon love and goodness was the remembrance of the aged, wrinkled face
      so wonderfully like his own. In a corner behind the door there stood an
      old-fashioned trundle-bed. As Joe stepped into the room a child, perhaps
      ten years old, started up from it, exclaiming &ldquo;That's the man, Granny; the
      man who put me on his shoulder, when Mariar was cross. Come in! come in,
      man,&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, Cynthy,&rdquo; retorted the grandmother, not unkindly, as she placed
      a chair for Joe, who was walking over to the little bed from which the
      child was evidently not able to rise alone. Two frail hands were
      outstretched to him, two great black eyes were raised to his full of
      unspoken gratitude. Joe took the soiled letter from its hiding-place and
      gave it to the woman without a word. She glanced at the scarcely legible
      characters, and went into an adjoining room, her impassive face working
      convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with Granny, was she crying? I never seen her cry
      before,&rdquo; said Cynthy. &ldquo;Granny's had heaps o' trouble. I'm all thet's left
      of ten children and a half-dozen grandchildren. She says I'm the poorest
      of the lot, too, with the big bone thet's grow'd out on my back; it aches
      orful nights, and makes my feet so tired and shaky mornin's. Granny's kind
      o' queer; some days she just sets and looks into the fire fer hours
      without speakin', and it's so still I kin a'most hear my heart beat; and I
      think, and think, and never speak, neither, till Granny comes back and
      leans over me and kisses me; then it's all right ag'in, an' Granny makes a
      cup o' tea an' a bite o' toast and the sun comes in the winder, and I
      forget 'bout the pain, an' go out with Mariar, when she'll take me, like I
      did last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's white, pinched features flushed feverishly, her solemn, dusky
      eyes burned like coals. She had been resting her chin in her hands, and
      gazing up into Joe's face with a fascinated intensity. She fell back
      wearily upon the pillows as the door opened, and her grandmother returned
      and put her hand on Joe's shoulder, saying brokenly, &ldquo;You've been very
      kind.&rdquo; The little clock on the shelf over the kitchen table ticked
      merrily, and the tea-kettle hummed, as if it would drown the ticking,
      while Joe and Cynthy's grandmother discussed and planned for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was finally settled that Joe should look for work in Danvers, and if he
      found it, his home should be with the old woman and Cynthy. He did not try
      to express the joy that surged over and through his heart, that rushed up
      into his brain, until his head was one mad whirl; but with a firm, quick
      step and a brave, calm look on his strong face, he went out to take his
      place in the busy, struggling world&mdash;a man among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months passed; months of toil, of anxiety, sometimes of fear; but Joe
      was so gladdened and comforted by Cynthy's childish love and confidence,
      that, little by little, he came out of the shadow that had threatened to
      blacken his life, into the sunshine and peace of a homely,
      self-sacrificing existence in &ldquo;Riverside Row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthy's ideas of heaven were very vague, and not always satisfactory,
      even to herself, but she often wondered, since Joe came, if heaven ever
      began here and she was not tasting some of its minor delights. Of course,
      she did not put it in just this way; but Cynthy's heaven was a place where
      children walked and were never tired, where above all things they wore
      pretty clothes and had everything that was denied them on earth. Joe had
      realized so many of the child's wild dreams, had made possible so many
      longed-for or unattainable pleasures, had so brightened and changed her
      weary, painful life, that to Cynthy's eyes there was always about his head
      a halo as in the pictures of Granny's saints; goodness, kindness,
      generosity&mdash;love, were for her spelled with three letters, and read&mdash;Joe.
      Out of the hard-earned wages the man put into Granny's hand every Saturday
      night, there was always a little reserved for Cynthy. Her grandmother
      sometimes fretted or occasionally remonstrated; but Joe was firm. Alas!
      human life, like the never-resting earth, of which it is a part, swings
      out of the sunlight into the shadow, out of the daytime into the darkness
      through which the moon and the stars do not always shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, a bitter, stormy night in November, he was a little late in
      leaving his work. He had to pass, on his way out of the building, a knot
      of men who were talking in suppressed voices. They did not ask him to join
      them, but the words &ldquo;prison-scab,&rdquo; &ldquo;jail-bird&rdquo;, fell on his ever-alert
      ear. With a shudder he hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granny was stooping over the trundle-bed in a vain attempt to quiet the
      child, who was tossing upon it, in pain and delirium. Cynthy had slipped
      upon a piece of ice a few days before, and now she was never free from the
      torturing, burning pain in her back. Sometimes it was in her head, too,
      and then with shrill, harsh cries, she begged for Joe, until Granny
      thanked God when the factory-whistle blew and she heard the man's quick,
      short step on the pavement. Joe warmed himself at the fire for a moment,
      then taking Cynthy in his tired arms, he walked slowly up and down the
      room. Through the long, dreary night he patiently carried the moaning
      child. If he attempted, never so carefully, to lay her down, she clung to
      him so wildly or cried so wearily that Joe could only soothe her and take
      lip the tiresome march again. Granny, thoroughly worn out, sat sleeping in
      her large chair. Cynthy grew more restless. Once she nearly sprang from
      Joe's arms, screaming, &ldquo;Go way, Mariar; you're a hateful thing! I won't
      listen; 'tain't true; Joe is good,&rdquo; and dropping back heavily, she
      whispered, &ldquo;I love you, Joe.&rdquo; She knew, then! Joe thought his heart would
      never throb again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened for the early morning whistles. One by one they sounded on the
      clear, keen air, but never the one for which he waited. As soon as it was
      light, he peered through the ice-covered window at the tall chimneys just
      beyond the &ldquo;Row.&rdquo; They rose grim and silent, but no smoke issued from
      them. The end had come. Joe knew a strike was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime in the afternoon of that day Cynthy suffered herself to be placed
      on the small, white bed; but she was not willing Joe should leave her, and
      was quiet only when he held her feeble hand in his close grasp. No sound
      escaped the man's white lips. Only God and the angels watched his struggle
      with the powers of darkness. As night came on again, Cynthy sank into a
      heavy sleep, and Joe, released, took his hat and went out very softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped after a long walk at the massive doors of a &ldquo;West End&rdquo; palace.
      He followed with downcast eyes the servant who answered his ring into a
      small but elegant reception-room, where he was told he might wait for the
      master of the house, the owner of the large manufactory where he was
      employed. Into the patient ear of this man, whom he had never seen before,
      Joe poured the story of his life. The sin, the shame, the agony of
      despair, his salvation through Cynthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call my son,&rdquo; said the sympathizing old gentleman as Joe rose to
      go; &ldquo;he is one of Danvers' best physicians. He will go with you and see
      what can be done for the little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the two men were bending over the sick child. &ldquo;She is very
      ill,&rdquo; said the young doctor, in reply ta Joe's mute, appealing face. &ldquo;This
      stupor may end in death, or it may result in a sleep which will bring
      relief. You must be brave, my friend. A few hours to-night will decide.
      You may hope.&rdquo; Joe's weary limbs faltered beneath him. He fell upon his
      knees breathing a wordless prayer that the child might be spared to bless
      and comfort hi&amp; lonely, aching heart; while all unseen the Angel of
      Life hovered over the little bed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
